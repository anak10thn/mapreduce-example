Introduction  one page 
 
This etext was originally created in 19641965 according to Dr 
Project Gutenberg  We had heard of this etext for years but it 
was not until 1991 that we actually managed to track it down to 
the copying and get it to us  Then another month to convert to 
something we could massage with our favorite 486 in DOS  After 
that is was only a matter of days to get it into this shape you 
let anyone fool you into thinking any etext with both upper and 
lower case is an original all those original Project Gutenberg 
etexts were also in upper case and were translated or rewritten 
many times to get them into their current condition  They have 
been worked on by many people throughout the world 
 
In the course of our searches for Professor Raben and his etext 
we were never able to determine where copies were or which of a 
variety of editions he may have used as a source  We did get a 
copy of the etext we were unwilling to release it without first 
determining that it was in fact Public Domain and finding Raben 
subscription request as the computers usually handle them The 
current edition prepared 
 
To give you an estimation of the difference in the original and 
what we have today  the original was probably entered on cards 
single card could hold 80 characters hence 80 characters is an 
characters at the time probably the keyboards operated at baud 
the keyboard to keep up 
 
This is the second version of Paradise Lost released by Project 
 
 
 
 
 
Paradise Lost 
 
 
 
 
Book I 
 
 
Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste 
That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed 
In the beginning how the heavens and earth 
That with no middle flight intends to soar 
Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme 
And justify the ways of God to men 
Nor the deep tract of Hellsay first what cause 
Who first seduced them to that foul revolt 
With vain attempt Him the Almighty Power 
  Nine times the space that measures day and night 
Reserved him to more wrath for now the thought 
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain 
Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate 
The dismal situation waste and wild 
As one great furnace flamed yet from those flames 
No light but rather darkness visible 
With everburning sulphur unconsumed 
Such place Eternal Justice has prepared 
For those rebellious here their prison ordained 
As far removed from God and light of Heaven 
Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell 
And hazard in the glorious enterprise 
In equal ruin into what pit thou seest 
From what height fallen so much the stronger proved 
He with his thunder and till then who knew 
Nor what the potent Victor in his rage 
And to the fierce contentions brought along 
His utmost power with adverse power opposed 
And shook his throne What though the field be lost 
And courage never to submit or yield 
And what is else not to be overcome 
That glory never shall his wrath or might 
Extort from me To bow and sue for grace 
Doubted his empirethat were low indeed 
That were an ignominy and shame beneath 
We may with more successful hope resolve 
And him thus answered soon his bold compeer 
Too well I see and rue the dire event 
As far as Gods and heavenly Essences 
Can perish for the mind and spirit remains 
Here swallowed up in endless misery 
But what if he our Conqueror whom I now 
Or do him mightier service as his thralls 
Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep 
What can it the avail though yet we feel 
Doing or suffering but of this be sure 
As being the contrary to his high will 
Whom we resist If then his providence 
And out of good still to find means of evil 
Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps 
His inmost counsels from their destined aim 
But see the angry Victor hath recalled 
His ministers of vengeance and pursuit 
The fiery surge that from the precipice 
To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep 
Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe 
Save what the glimmering of these livid flames 
Casts pale and dreadful Thither let us tend 
From off the tossing of these fiery waves 
Consult how we may henceforth most offend 
That sparkling blazed his other parts besides 
Chained on the burning lake nor ever thence 
And high permission of allruling Heaven 
That with reiterated crimes he might 
How all his malice served but to bring forth 
  Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool 
His mighty stature on each hand the flames 
Then with expanded wings he steers his flight 
That felt unusual weight till on dry land 
He lightsif it were land that ever burned 
And such appeared in hue as when the force 
Of subterranean wind transprots a hill 
And leave a singed bottom all involved 
With stench and smoke Such resting found the sole 
Of unblest feet Him followed his next mate 
Both glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood 
Not by the sufferance of supernal Power 
That we must change for Heaventhis mournful gloom 
Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid 
What shall be right farthest from him is best 
Receive thy new possessorone who brings 
A mind not to be changed by place or time 
Whom thunder hath made greater Here at least 
Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven 
And call them not to share with us their part 
With rallied arms to try what may be yet 
  So Satan spake and him Beelzebub 
Of hope in fears and dangersheard so oft 
Their surest signalthey will soon resume 
  He scare had ceased when the superior Fiend 
Behind him cast The broad circumference 
Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views 
His spearto equal which the tallest pine 
Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks 
High overarched embower or scattered sedge 
While with perfidious hatred they pursued 
From the safe shore their floating carcases 
Under amazement of their hideous change 
He called so loud that all the hollow deep 
If such astonishment as this can seize 
Eternal Spirits Or have ye chosen this place 
After the toil of battle to repose 
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn 
Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood 
His swift pursuers from Heavengates discern 
Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf 
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake 
Nor did they not perceive the evil plight 
Innumerable As when the potent rod 
So numberless were those bad Angels seen 
Of their great Sultan waving to direct 
A multitude like which the populous North 
Poured never from her frozen loins to pass 
Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands 
The heads and leaders thither haste where stood 
Excelling human princely Dignities 
Though on their names in Heavenly records now 
By their rebellion from the Books of Life 
Nor had they yet among the sons of Eve 
By falsities and lies the greatest part 
Of mankind they corrupted to forsake 
Glory of him that made them to transform 
And devils to adore for deities 
And various idols through the heathen world 
While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof 
Abominations and with cursed things 
And with their darkness durst affront his light 
To his grim idol Him the Ammonite 
Of utmost Arnon Nor content with such 
Of Solomon he led by fraoud to build 
His temple right against the temple of God 
From Aroar to Nebo and the wild 
Of southmost Abarim in Hesebon 
Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged 
Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell 
Of old Euphrates to the brook that parts 
And works of love or enmity fulfil 
For those the race of Israel oft forsook 
To bestial gods for which their heads as low 
Of despicable foes With these in troop 
To whose bright image nigntly by the moon 
Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs 
Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured 
The Syrian damsels to lament his fate 
While smooth Adonis from his native rock 
Of Thammuz yearly wounded the lovetale 
Whose wanton passions in the sacred proch 
His eye surveyed the dark idolatries 
Of alienated Judah Next came one 
Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers 
And downward fish yet had his temple high 
He also against the house of God was bold 
Whom he had vanquished After these appeared 
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused 
Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek 
Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms 
Rather than human Nor did Israel scape 
The calf in Oreb and the rebel king 
Likening his Maker to the grazed ox 
Both her firstborn and all her bleating gods 
Belial came last than whom a Spirit more lewd 
Vice for itself To him no temple stood 
Or altar smoked yet who more oft than he 
With lust and violence the house of God 
  These were the prime in order and in might 
The rest were long to tell though far renowned 
Of Doric land or who with Saturn old 
  All these and more came flocking but with looks 
Downcast and damp yet such wherein appeared 
Obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their Chief 
In loss itself which on his countenance cast 
His mighty standard That proud honour claimed 
Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled 
Seraphic arms and trophies all the while 
Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds 
At which the universal host upsent 
Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night 
All in a moment through the gloom were seen 
With orient colours waving with them rose 
A forest huge of spears and thronging helms 
Of depth immeasurable Anon they move 
In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood 
Of flutes and soft recorderssuch as raised 
To height of noblest temper heroes old 
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat 
Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage 
Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain 
Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed 
Advanced in view they standa horrid front 
Awaiting what command their mighty Chief 
Had to impose He through the armed files 
Their visages and stature as of gods 
Their number last he sums And now his heart 
Could merit more than that small infantry 
Warred on by cranesthough all the giant brood 
Mixed with auxiliar gods and what resounds 
Begirt with British and Armoric knights 
Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore 
When Charlemain with all his peerage fell 
By Fontarabbia Thus far these beyond 
Stood like a tower His form had yet not lost 
Of glory obscured as when the sun newrisen 
Looks through the horizontal misty air 
For ever now to have their lot in pain 
Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced 
Stands on the blasted heath He now prepared 
To speak whereat their doubled ranks they bend 
With all his peers attention held them mute 
Words interwove with sighs found out their way 
Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure 
New war provoked our better part remains 
What force effected not that he no less 
By force hath overcome but half his foe 
Space may produce new Worlds whereof so rife 
There went a fame in Heaven that he ere long 
A generation whom his choice regard 
Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven 
For this infernal pit shall never hold 
Long under darkness cover But these thoughts 
Full counsel must mature Peace is despaired 
Of mighty Cherubim the sudden blaze 
Far round illumined Hell Highly they raged 
Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven 
Belched fire and rolling smoke the rest entire 
Shone with a glossy scurfundoubted sign 
A numerous brigade hastened as when bands 
Or cast a rampart Mammon led them on 
From Heaven for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts 
Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed 
In vision beatific By him first 
Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth 
For treasures better hid Soon had his crew 
And digged out ribs of gold Let none admire 
That riches grow in Hell that soil may best 
Deserve the precious bane And here let those 
Learn how their greatest monuments of fame 
That underneath had veins of liquid fire 
A third as soon had formed within the ground 
By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook 
To many a row of pipes the soundboard breathes 
Anon out of the earth a fabric huge 
Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet 
With golden architrave nor did there want 
The roof was fretted gold Not Babylon 
Nor great Alcairo such magnificence 
As from a sky The hasty multitude 
And some the architect His hand was known 
Nor was his name unheard or unadored 
In ancient Greece and in Ausonian land 
Men called him Mulciber and how he fell 
Erring for he with this rebellious rout 
Fell long before nor aught aviled him now 
To have built in Heaven high towers nor did he scape 
A solemn council forthwith to be held 
Of Satan and his peers Their summons called 
From every band and squared regiment 
By place or choice the worthiest they anon 
With hundreds and with thousands trooping came 
Attended All access was thronged the gates 
Defied the best of Paynim chivalry 
Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings As bees 
Pour forth their populous youth about the hive 
In clusters they among fresh dews and flowers 
Their stateaffairs so thick the airy crowd 
Behold a wonder They but now who seemed 
Throng numberlesslike that pygmean race 
At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds 
Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms 
The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim

Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand 
His proud imaginations thus displayed 
I give not Heaven for lost from this descent 
Celestial Virtues rising will appear 
And trust themselves to fear no second fate 
With what besides in council or in fight 
Yielded with full consent The happier state 
Envy from each inferior but who here 
Will envy whom the highest place exposes 
From faction for none sure will claim in Hell 
Precedence none whose portion is so small 
Of present pain that with ambitious mind 
Surer to prosper than prosperity 
Stood upthe strongest and the fiercest Spirit 
Cared not to be at all with that care lost 
The prison of his ryranny who reigns 
Turning our tortures into horrid arms 
Black fire and horror shot with equal rage 
His own invented torments But perhaps 
With upright wing against a higher foe 
That in our porper motion we ascend 
Up to our native seat descent and fall 
When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear 
With what compulsion and laborious flight 
Fear to be worse destroyed What can be worse 
In this abhorred deep to utter woe 
Where pain of unextinguishable fire 
Must exercise us without hope of end 
What fear we then what doubt we to incense 
To nothing this essentialhappier far 
Than miserable to have eternal being 
On this side nothing and by proof we feel 
A fairer person lost not Heaven he seemed 
But all was false and hollow though his tongue 
Maturest counsels for his thoughts were low 
And with persuasive accent thus began 
Main reason to persuade immediate war 
Ominous conjecture on the whole success 
In what he counsels and in what excels 
Impregnable oft on the bodering Deep 
With blackest insurrection to confound 
Is flat despair we must exasperate 
And that must end us that must be our cure 
Is doubtful that he never will is sure 
Them in his anger whom his anger saves 
The Deep to shelter us This Hell then seemed 
A refuge from those wounds Or when we lay 
Chained on the burning lake That sure was worse 
And plunge us in the flames or from above 
Should intermitted vengeance arm again 
His red right hand to plague us What if all 
Ages of hopeless end This would be worse 
My voice dissuades for what can force or guile 
Not more almighty to resist our might 
Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles 
By my advice since fate inevitable 
Our strength is equal nor the law unjust 
I laugh when those who at the spear are bold 
What yet they know must followto endure 
The sentence of their Conqueror This is now 
Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit 
With what is punished whence these raging fires 
Our purer essence then will overcome 
Besides what hope the neverending flight 
Worth waitingsince our present lot appears 
Not peace and after him thus Mammon spake 
Our own right lost Him to unthrone we then 
The latter for what place can be for us 
We overpower Suppose he should relent 
Of new subjection with what eyes could we 
Our servile offerings This must be our task 
Eternity so spent in worship paid 
Of splendid vassalage but rather seek 
Hard liberty before the easy yoke 
Of servile pomp Our greatness will appear 
Through labour and endurance This deep world 
Of darkness do we dread How oft amidst 
And with the majesty of darkness round 
Imitate when we please This desert soil 
Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise 
Magnificence and what can Heaven show more 
Into their temper which must needs remove 
The sensible of pain All things invite 
After the tempest Such applause was heard 
Advising peace for such another field 
They dreaded worse than Hell so much the fear 
Of thunder and the sword of Michael 
Wrought still within them and no less desire 
In emulation opposite to Heaven 
A pillar of state Deep on his front engraven 
The weight of mightiest monarchies his look 
Drew audience and attention still as night 
Ethereal Virtues or these titles now 
Princes of Hell for so the popular vote 
And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed 
What sit we then projecting peace and war 
War hath determined us and foiled with loss 
Irreparable terms of peace yet none 
Vouchsafed or sought for what peace will be given 
And stripes and arbitrary punishment 
Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least 
In doing what we most in suffering feel 
With dangerous expedition to invade 
Or ambush from the Deep What if we find 
Some easier enterprise There is a place 
If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven 
Of him who rules above so was his will 
Some advantageous act may be achieved 
By sudden onseteither with Hellfire 
Abolish his own works This would surpass 
Faded so soon Advise if this be worth 
Pleaded his devilish counselfirst devised 
The great Creator But their spite still serves 
His glory to augment The bold design 
Sparkled in all their eyes with full assent 
They vote whereat his speech he thus renews 
Nearer our ancient seatperhaps in view 
Reenter Heaven or else in some mild zone 
In search of this new World whom shall we find 
Sufficient who shall tempt with wandering feet 
And through the palpable obscure find out 
Upborne with indefatigable wings 
Through the strict senteries and stations thick 
Of Angels watching round Here he had need 
All circumspection and we now no less 
Choice in our suffrage for on whom we send 
Pondering the danger with deep thoughts and each 
Astonished None among the choice and prime 
Of those Heavenwarring champions could be found 
With reason hath deep silence and demur 
And judged of public moment in the shape 
Me from attempting Wherefore do I assume 
Refusing to accept as great a share 
Of hazard more as he above the rest 
More tolerable if there be cure or charm 
Of this ill mansion intermit no watch 
Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek 
Deliverance for us all This enterprise 
Which he through hazard huge must earn But they 
Forbidding and at once with him they rose 
Their rising all at once was as the sound 
Of thunder heard remote Towards him they bend 
Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven 
Nor failed they to express how much they praised 
That for the general safety he despised 
His own for neither do the Spirits damned 
Lose all their virtue lest bad men should boast 
  Thus they their doubtful consultations dark 
O shame to men Devil with devil damned 
Firm concord holds men only disagree 
As if which might induce us to accord 
That day and night for his destruction wait 
  The Stygian council thus dissolved and forth 
In order came the grand infernal Peers 
And godlike imitated state him round 
A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed 
Then of their session ended they bid cry 
Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim 
With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim 
To battle in the clouds before each van 
Till thickest legions close with feats of arms 
From either end of heaven the welkin burns 
In whirlwind Hell scarce holds the wild uproar 
And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw 
With notes angelical to many a harp 
Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance 
Their song was partial but the harmony 
What could it less when Spirits immortal sing 
The thronging audience In discourse more sweet 
With stubborn patience as with triple steel 
On bold adventure to discover wide 
Into the burning lake their baleful streams 
Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage 
Forthwith his former state and being forgets 
Beyond this flood a frozen continent 
A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog 
Where armies whole have sunk the parching air 
At certain revolutions all the damned 
Are brought and feel by turns the bitter change 
From beds of raging fire to starve in ice 
They ferry over this Lethean sound 
Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards 
The lip of Tantalus Thus roving on 
No rest Through many a dark and dreary vale 
Explores his solitary flight sometimes 
Up to the fiery concave towering high 
As when far off at sea a fleet descried 
Ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed 
Far off the flying Fiend At last appear 
Yet unconsumed Before the gates there sat 
On either side a formidable Shape 
Voluminous and vasta serpent armed 
With mortal sting About her middle round 
A cry of Hellhounds neverceasing barked 
And kennel there yet there still barked and howled 
Within unseen Far less abhorred than these 
Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore 
Eclipses at their charms The other Shape 
If shape it might be called that shape had none 
And shook a dreadful dart what seemed his head 
The likeness of a kingly crown had on 
The monster moving onward came as fast 
With horrid strides Hell trembled as he strode 
And with disdainful look thus first began 
Thy miscreated front athwart my way 
Conjured against the Highestfor which both thou 
To waste eternal days in woe and pain 
Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue 
That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge 
Shakes pestilence and war Each at the head 
Levelled his deadly aim their fatal hands 
No second stroke intend and such a frown 
To join their dark encounter in midair 
So frowned the mighty combatants that Hell 
Grew darker at their frown so matched they stood 
For never but once more was wither like 
To meet so great a foe And now great deeds 
Possesses thee to bend that mortal dart 
Forbore then these to her Satan returned 
Now in thine eye so foulonce deemed so fair 
Of all the Seraphim with thee combined 
All on a sudden miserable pain 
Out of thy head I sprung Amazement seized 
With me in secret that my womb conceived 
And fields were fought in Heaven wherein remained 
For what could else to our Almighty Foe 
Clear victory to our part loss and rout 
Into this Deep and in the general fall 
I also at which time this powerful key 
Without my opening Pensive here I sat 
Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes 
Transformed but he my inbred enemy 
That rest or intermission none I find 
Before mine eyes in opposition sits 
Whenever that shall be so Fate pronounced 
His deadly arrow neither vainly hope 
  She finished and the subtle Fiend his lore 
From out this dark and dismal house of pain 
Fell with us from on high From them I go 
Created vast and rounda place of bliss 
In the purlieus of Heaven and therein placed 
And bring ye to the place where thou and Death 
With odours There ye shall be fed and filled 
Destined to that good hour No less rejoiced 
These adamantine gates against all force 
Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born 
With terrors and with clamours compassed round 
But thee whom follow Thou wilt bring me soon 
Could once have moved then in the keyhole turns 
Of massy iron or solid rock with ease 
Of Erebus She opened but to shut 
With horse and chariots ranked in loose array 
Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame 
Before their eyes in sudden view appear 
The secrets of the hoary Deepa dark 
Their embryon atoms they around the flag 
Their lighter wings To whom these most adhere 
And by decision more embroils the fray 
But all these in their pregnant causes mixed 
His dark materials to create more worlds 
Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend 
Pondering his voyage for no narrow frith 
He had to cross Nor was his ear less pealed 
With noises loud and ruinous to compare 
Great things with small than when Bellona storms 
Some capital city or less than if this frame 
In mutiny had from her axle torn 
The steadfast Earth At last his sailbroad vans 
As many miles aloft That fury stayed 
Half flying behoves him now both oar and sail 
As when a gryphon through the wilderness 
Had from his wakeful custody purloined 
The guarded gold so eagerly the Fiend 
At length a universal hubbub wild 
With loudest vehemence Thither he plies 
Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss 
Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies 
Bordering on light when straight behold the throne 
Wide on the wasteful Deep With him enthroned 
The consort of his reign and by them stood 
And Discord with a thousand various mouths 
With purpose to explore or to disturb 
What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds 
I travel this profound Direct my course 
To her original darkness and your sway 
Erect the standard there of ancient Night 
I saw and heard for such a numerous host 
Confusion worse confounded and Heavengates 
Pursuing I upon my frontiers here 
Keep residence if all I can will serve 
Encroached on still through our intestine broils 
To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell 
With fresh alacrity and force renewed 
And more endangered than when Argo passed 
Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned 
So he with difficulty and labour hard 
Following his track such was the will of Heaven 
Paved after him a broad and beaten way 
Of this frail World by which the Spirits perverse 
With easy intercourse pass to and fro 
God and good Angels guard by special grace 
  But now at last the sacred influence 
Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night 
A glimmering dawn Here Nature first begins 
With tumult less and with less hostile din 
With opal towers and battlements adorned 
Of smallest magnitude close by the moon

Or of the Eternal coeternal beam 
And never but in unapproached light 
Bright effluence of bright essence increate 
Won from the void and formless infinite 
With other notes than to the Orphean lyre 
I sung of Chaos and eternal Night 
Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down 
And feel thy sovran vital lamp but thou 
Smit with the love of sacred song but chief 
Nightly I visit  nor sometimes forget 
Harmonious numbers as the wakeful bird 
Tunes her nocturnal note  Thus with the year 
Seasons return but not to me returns 
Presented with a universal blank 
And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out 
Of things invisible to mortal sight 
From the pure empyrean where he sits 
His own works and their works at once to view 
About him all the Sanctities of Heaven 
Beatitude past utterance on his right 
His only son on earth he first beheld 
Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night 
Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake 
Transports our Adversary  whom no bounds 
By some false guile pervert and shall pervert 
Sole pledge of his obedience  So will fall 
He and his faithless progeny  Whose fault 
Such I created all the ethereal Powers 
Not what they would  what praise could they receive 
When will and reason reason also is choice 
Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed 
Which had no less proved certain unforeknown 
Till they enthrall themselves I else must change 
Beyond compare the Son of God was seen 
Most glorious in him all his Father shone 
For which both Heaven and earth shall high extol 
Or shall the Adversary thus obtain 
By him corrupted  or wilt thou thyself 
So should thy goodness and thy greatness both 
To whom the great Creator thus replied 
As my eternal purpose hath decreed 
By sin to foul exorbitant desires 
On even ground against his mortal foe 
Elect above the rest so is my will 
And none but such from mercy I exclude 
Die he or justice must unless for him 
Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear 
Much less that durst upon his own head draw 
And now without redemption all mankind 
I offer on me let thine anger fall 
Account me Man I for his sake will leave 
 Well pleased on me let Death wreak all his rage 
 Under his gloomy power I shall not long 
 Lie vanquished Thou hast given me to possess 
 Life in myself for ever by thee I live 
  thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave 
 For ever with corruption there to dwell 
 I through the ample air in triumph high 
 And reconcilement wrath shall be no more 
 His words here ended but his meek aspect 
 Filial obedience as a sacrifice 
 Of his great Father Admiration seized 
 O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace 
 
     00021053  
 Their nature also to thy nature join 
So dearly to redeem what hellish hate 
Far more than great or high because in thee 
Love hath abounded more than glory abounds 
Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt 
With thee thy manhood also to this throne 
Anointed universal King all power 
The summoning ArchAngels to proclaim 
Shall hasten such a peal shall rouse their sleep 
Thenceforth shall be for ever shut  Mean while 
The eternal regions  Lowly reverent 
With solemn adoration down they cast 
Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold 
And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven 
With these that never fade the Spirits elect 
Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams 
Impurpled with celestial roses smiled 
Of charming symphony they introduce 
Whom else no creature can behold on thee 
Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests 
He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein 
By thee created and by thee threw down 
The aspiring Dominations  Thou that day 
Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed 
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim 
No sooner did thy dear and only Son 
Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man 
Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat 
Love no where to be found less than Divine 
Shall be the copious matter of my song 
Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent 
Mean while upon the firm opacous globe 
Satan alighted walks  A globe far off 
Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud 
Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field 
Dislodging from a region scarce of prey 
But in his way lights on the barren plains 
With sails and wind their cany waggons light 
Up hither like aereal vapours flew 
With vanity had filled the works of men 
Or happiness in this or the other life 
Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed 
Betwixt the angelical and human kind 
Hither of illjoined sons and daughters born 
First from the ancient world those giants came 
The builders next of Babel on the plain 
Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised 
And that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs 
A violent cross wind from either coast 
Into the devious air  Then might ye see 
Of dawning light turned thitherward in haste 
His travelled steps far distant he descries 
Ascending by degrees magnificent 
Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high 
With frontispiece of diamond and gold 
Embellished thick with sparkling orient gems 
These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw 
Dreaming by night under the open sky 
Viewless and underneath a bright sea flowed 
Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds 
His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss 
Wider by far than that of aftertimes 
Over the Promised Land to God so dear 
On high behests his angels to and fro 
Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore 
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view 
Through darknd desart ways withoeril gone 
Which to his eye discovers unaware 
The goodly prospect of some foreign land 
Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams 
At sight of all this world beheld so fair 
So high above the circling canopy 
Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears 
Andromeda far off Atlantick seas 
Beyond the horizon then from pole to pole 
Through the pure marble air his oblique way 
Thrice happy isles but who dwelt happy there 
He staid not to inquire  Above them all 
Allured his eye thither his course he bends 
Their starry dance in numbers that compute 
Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep 
So wonderously was set his station bright 
Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw 
Drained through a limbeck to his native form 
What wonder then if fields and regions here 
Here in the dark so many precious things 
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met 
Undazzled far and wide his eye commands 
The same whom John saw also in the sun 
Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar 
Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings 
Lay waving round on some great charge employed 
To find who might direct his wandering flight 
Which else might work him danger or delay 
Under a coronet his flowing hair 
In curls on either cheek played wings he wore 
Before his decent steps a silver wand 
The first art wont his great authentick will 
Where all his sons thy embassy attend 
And here art likeliest by supreme decree 
To visit oft this new creation round 
Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim 
In which of all these shining orbs hath Man 
But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell 
On whom the great Creator hath bestowed 
The universal Maker we may praise 
Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes 
Created this new happy race of Men 
To serve him better  Wise are all his ways 
So spake the false dissembler unperceived 
For neither Man nor Angel can discern 
Where no ill seems  Which now for once beguiled 
The sharpestsighted Spirit of all in Heaven 
Had in remembrance always with delight 
But what created mind can comprehend 
Swift to their several quarters hasted then 
And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven 
The rest in circuit walls this universe 
Night would invade but there the neighbouring moon 
So call that opposite fair star her aid 
With borrowed light her countenance triform 
And in her pale dominion checks the night 
Throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel

To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss 
Begins his dire attempt which nigh the birth 
And like a devilish engine back recoils 
Upon himself horrour and doubt distract 
The Hell within him for within him Hell 
That slumbered wakes the bitter memory 
Worse of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue 
Which now sat high in his meridian tower 
Lookest from thy sole dominion like the God 
Of this new world at whose sight all the stars 
That bring to my remembrance from what state 
Till pride and worse ambition threw me down 
Upbraided none nor was his service hard 
And wrought but malice lifted up so high 
And understood not that a grateful mind 
Indebted and discharged what burden then 
Then happy no unbounded hope had raised 
Ambition  Yet why not some other Power 
Drawn to his part but other Powers as great 
Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand 
Chose freely what it now so justly rues 
Me miserable which way shall I fly 
Which way I fly is Hell myself am Hell 
To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven 
None left but by submission and that word 
With other promises and other vaunts 
The Omnipotent  Ay me they little know 
While they adore me on the throne of Hell 
In misery  Such joy ambition finds 
What feigned submission swore  Ease would recant 
Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep 
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse 
And heavier fall  so should I purchase dear 
Short intermission bought with double smart 
This knows my Punisher therefore as far 
For heavenly minds from such distempers foul 
Artificer of fraud and was the first 
Yet not enough had practised to deceive 
Uriel once warned whose eye pursued him down 
 Spirit of happy sort his gestures fierce 
Access denied and overhead upgrew 
 Of stateliest view Yet higher than their tops 
 The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung                        
 
    00081429  
Which to our general sire gave prospect large 
Into his nether empire neighbouring round 
And higher than that wall a circling row 
On which the sun more glad impressed his beams 
When God hath showered the earth so lovely seemed 
That landskip  And of pure now purer air 
Those balmy spoils  As when to them who fail 
Sabean odours from the spicy shore 
Of Araby the blest with such delay 
Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles 
Who came their bane though with them better pleased 
Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume 
Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill 
Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed 
All path of man or beast that passed that way 
At one flight bound high overleaped all bound 
Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve 
So since into his church lewd hirelings climb 
Sat like a cormorant yet not true life 
To them who lived nor on the virtue thought 
Of immortality  So little knows 
A Heaven on Earth  For blissful Paradise 
Of Eden planted Eden stretched her line 
From Auran eastward to the royal towers 
Of where the sons of Eden long before 
Dwelt in Telassar  In this pleasant soil 
His far more pleasant garden God ordained 
Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow 
Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill 
Passed underneath ingulfed for God had thrown 
That mountain as his gardenmould high raised 
Watered the garden thence united fell 
With mazy errour under pendant shades 
Both where the morning sun first warmly smote 
Imbrowned the noontide bowers  Thus was this place 
A happy rural seat of various view 
Or palmy hillock or the flowery lap 
Luxuriant mean while murmuring waters fall 
That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned 
Led on the eternal Spring  Not that fair field 
Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis 
To seek her through the world nor that sweet grove 
Of Eden strive nor that Nyseian isle 
True Paradise under the Ethiop line 
In naked majesty seemed lords of all 
And worthy seemed for in their looks divine 
Whence true authority in men though both 
For contemplation he and valour formed 
For softness she and sweet attractive grace 
His fair large front and eye sublime declared 
Absolute rule and hyacinthine locks 
Round from his parted forelock manly hung 
Her unadorned golden tresses wore 
Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed 
Simplicity and spotless innocence 
Of God or Angel for they thought no ill 
Adam the goodliest man of men since born 
Under a tuft of shade that on a green 
Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed 
Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs 
On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers 
Alone as they  About them frisking played 
Gave proof unheeded others on the grass 
Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose 
Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad 
O Hell what do mine eyes with grief behold 
Into our room of bliss thus high advanced 
Little inferiour whom my thoughts pursue 
The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured 
Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe 
As now is entered yet no purposed foe 
Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge 
On you who wrong me not for him who wronged 
And should I at your harmless innocence 
Then from his lofty stand on that high tree 
Down he alights among the sportful herd 
By word or action marked About them round 
A lion now he stalks with fiery glare 
Dearer thyself than all needs must the Power 
As liberal and free as infinite 
Aught whereof he hath need he who requires 
From us no other service than to keep 
In Paradise that bear delicious fruit 
Some dreadful thing no doubt for well thou knowest 
Among so many signs of power and rule 
Over all other creatures that possess 
Unlimited of manifold delights 
To whom thus Eve replied  O thou for whom 
And head what thou hast said is just and right 
Like consort to thyself canst no where find 
Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound 
Pure as the expanse of Heaven I thither went 
Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks 
Of sympathy and love  There I had fixed 
Than that smooth watery image  Back I turned 
Seised mine  I yieldedand from that time see 
On our first father half her swelling breast 
Of her loose tresses hid he in delight 
That shed Mayflowers and pressed her matron lip 
With kisses pure  Aside the Devil turned 
For envy yet with jealous leer malign 
Still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines 
Yet let me not forget what I have gained 
Forbidden them to taste  Knowledge forbidden 
Envy them that  Can it be sin to know 
Can it be death  And do they only stand 
The proof of their obedience and their faith 
O fair foundation laid whereon to build 
Their ruin hence I will excite their minds 
They taste and die  What likelier can ensue 
But first with narrow search I must walk round 
A chance but chance may lead where I may meet 
Against the eastern gate of Paradise 
Levelled his evening rays  It was a rock 
About him exercised heroick games 
From what point of his compass to beware 
Impetuous winds  He thus began in haste 
No evil thing approach or enter in 
This day at highth of noon came to my sphere 
New troubles him thy care must be to find 
To whom the winged warriour thus returned 
See far and wide  In at this gate none pass 
Well known from Heaven and since meridian hour 
Spiritual substance with corporeal bar 
So promised he and Uriel to his charge 
Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen 
Arraying with reflected purple and gold 
The clouds that on his western throne attend 
Had in her sober livery all things clad 
She all night long her amorous descant sung 
Silence was pleased  Now glowed the firmament 
Mind us of like repose since God hath set 
Our eyelids  Other creatures all day long 
Man hath his daily work of body or mind 
And the regard of Heaven on all his ways 
And of their doings God takes no account 
More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth 
Unargued I obey  So God ordains 
With thee conversing I forget all time 
When first on this delightful land he spreads 
Glistering with dew fragrant the fertile earth 
After soft showers and sweet the coming on 
With charm of earliest birds nor rising sun 
Glistering with dew nor fragrance after showers 
But wherefore all night long shine these for whom 
To whom our general ancestor replied 
Lest total Darkness should by night regain 
In Nature and all things which these soft fires 
Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow 
Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth 
All these with ceaseless praise his works behold 
Both day and night  How often from the steep 
Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard 
Singing their great Creator oft in bands 
With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds 
On to their blissful bower it was a place 
Of thickest covert was inwoven shade 
Of firm and fragrant leaf on either side 
Such was their awe of Man  In shadier bower 
Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed 
What day the genial Angel to our sire 
Ordained by thee and this delicious place 
But thou hast promised from us two a race 
Mysterious of connubial love refused 
Whatever hypocrites austerely talk 
Defaming as impure what God declares 
Our Maker bids encrease who bids abstain 
In Paradise of all things common else 
By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men 
Among the bestial herds to range by thee 
Reigns here and revels not in the bought smile 
And on their naked limbs the flowery roof 
Now had night measured with her shadowy cone 
To their night watches in warlike parade 
When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake 
With strictest watch these other wheel the north 
Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen 
Hitherward bent who could have thought escaped 
Dazzling the moon these to the bower direct 
In search of whom they sought  Him there they found 
Assaying by his devilish art to reach 
Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride 
Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear 
Touched lightly for no falshood can endure 
Of force to its own likeness  Up he starts 
Discovered and surprised  As when a spark 
Fit for the tun some magazine to store 
So started up in his own shape the Fiend 
So sudden to behold the grisly king 
Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell 
Here watching at the head of these that sleep 
Know ye not me ye knew me once no mate 
As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure 
Departed from thee and thou resemblest now 
Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul 
His loss but chiefly to find here observed 
His lustre visibly impaired yet seemed 
Will save us trial what the least can do 
Champing his iron curb  To strive or fly 
He held it vain awe from above had quelled 
O friends  I hear the tread of nimble feet 
Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade 
But faded splendour wan who by his gait 
Not likely to part hence without contest 
To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake 
To question thy bold entrance on this place 
Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss 
To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow 
And such I held thee but this question asked 
Puts me in doubt  Lives there who loves his pain 
And boldly venture to whatever place 
But evil hast not tried and wilt object 
His will who bounds us  Let him surer bar 
In that dark durance  Thus much what was asked 
But that implies not violence or harm 
O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise 
Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise 
Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed 
So wise he judges it to fly from pain 
Can equal anger infinite provoked 
But wherefore thou alone wherefore with thee 
Came not all hell broke loose or thou than they 
Less hardy to endure  Courageous Chief 
The first in flight from pain hadst thou alleged 
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive 
Insulting Angel well thou knowest I stood 
And seconded thy else not dreaded spear 
Argue thy inexperience what behoves 
From hard assays and ill successes past 
Through ways of danger by himself untried 
Though for possession put to try once more 
What thou and thy gay legions dare against 
Whose easier business were to serve their Lord 
To whom the warriour Angel soon replied 
O sacred name of faithfulness profaned 
Faithful to whom to thy rebellious crew 
Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme 
Fly neither whence thou fledst  If from this hour 
The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred 
So threatened he but Satan to no threats 
Proud limitary Cherub but ere then 
Far heavier load thyself expect to feel 
In progress through the road of Heaven starpaved 
Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends 
Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves 
Sat Horrour plumed nor wanted in his grasp 
What seemed both spear and shield  Now dreadful deeds 
The pendulous round earth with balanced air 
The sequel each of parting and of fight 
To boast what arms can do since thine no more 
And read thy lot in yon celestial sign 
His mounted scale aloft  Nor morebut fled

Of birds on every bough so much the more 
His wonder was to find unwakened Eve 
Shot forth peculiar graces then with voice 
Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet 
Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk 
To find thee I directed then my walk 
That brought me on a sudden to the tree 
Much fairer to my fancy than by day 
One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven 
By us oft seen his dewy locks distilled 
Ambrosia on that tree he also gazed 
At such bold words vouched with a deed so bold 
Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part 
Which he had plucked the pleasant savoury smell 
Could not but taste  Forthwith up to the clouds 
And various  Wondering at my flight and change 
To this high exaltation suddenly 
To find this but a dream  Thus Eve her night 
The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep 
Affects me equally nor can I like 
Created pure  But know that in the soul 
Reason as chief among these Fancy next 
Her office holds of all external things 
Our knowledge or opinion then retires 
Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes 
Ill matching words and deeds long past or late 
But with addition strange yet be not sad 
Evil into the mind of God or Man 
No spot or blame behind  Which gives me hope 
Waking thou never will consent to do 
Than when fair morning first smiles on the world 
And let us to our fresh employments rise 
But silently a gentle tear let fall 
Soon as they forth were come to open sight 
Discovering in wide landskip all the east 
In various style for neither various style 
Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise 
Unmeditated such prompt eloquence 
More tuneable than needed lute or harp 
To add more sweetness and they thus began 
Thus wonderous fair  Thyself how wonderous then 
In these thy lowest works yet these declare 
Circle his throne rejoicing ye in Heaven 
On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol 
Acknowledge him thy greater sound his praise 
And nourish all things let your ceaseless change 
Vary to our great Maker still new praise 
Rising or falling still advance his praise 
Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise 
To give us only good and if the night 
Among sweet dews and flowers where any row 
Of fruittrees overwoody reached too far 
Fruitless embraces or they led the vine 
His barren leaves  Them thus employed beheld 
His marriage with the seventimeswedded maid 
Hath raised in Paradise and how disturbed 
This night the human pair how he designs 
In them at once to ruin all mankind 
Yet mutable whence warn him to beware 
The fall of others from like state of bliss 
All justice  Nor delayed the winged Saint 
After his charge received but from among 
Divine the sovran Architect had framed 
Above all hills  As when by night the glass 
Imagined lands and regions in the moon 
A cloudy spot  Down thither prone in flight 
At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise 
His lineaments divine the pair that clad 
With regal ornament the middle pair 
Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold 
And colours dipt in Heaven the third his feet 
The circuit wide  Straight knew him all the bands 
For on some message high they guessed him bound 
A wilderness of sweets for Nature here 
Him through the spicy forest onward come 
Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm 
Berry or grape  To whom thus Adam called 
Comes this way moving seems another morn 
Risen on midnoon some great behest from Heaven 
Our heavenly stranger  Well we may afford 
Save what by frugal storing firmness gains 
God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven 
Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change 
Heaps with unsparing hand for drink the grape 
She tempers dulcet creams nor these to hold 
Wants her fit vessels pure then strows the ground 
With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed 
Accompanied than with his own complete 
More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits 
None can than Heaven such glorious shape contain 
Those happy places thou hast deigned a while 
To rest and what the garden choicest bears 
Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild 
To visit thee lead on then where thy bower 
I have at will  So to the sylvan lodge 
Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven no veil 
Altered her cheek  On whom the Angel Hail 
Than with these various fruits the trees of God 
Have heaped this tableRaised of grassy turf 
And on her ample square from side to side 
Danced hand in hand  A while discourse they hold 
No fear lest dinner cool when thus began 
To us for food and for delight hath caused 
The earth to yield unsavoury food perhaps 
That one celestial Father gives to all 
To whom the Angel  Therefore what he gives 
Whose praise be ever sung to Man in part 
No ingrateful food  And food alike those pure 
As doth your rational and both contain 
Within them every lower faculty 
And corporeal to incorporeal turn 
To be sustained and fed  Of elements 
Vapours not yet into her substance turned 
Nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale 
From her moist continent to higher orbs 
From all his alimental recompence 
Sups with the ocean  Though in Heaven the trees 
Yield nectar though from off the boughs each morn 
Covered with pearly grain  Yet God hath here 
As may compare with Heaven and to taste 
And to their viands fell nor seemingly 
Of Theologians but with keen dispatch 
Through Spirits with ease nor wonderif by fire 
Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist 
As from the mine  Mean while at table Eve 
With pleasant liquours crowned  O innocence 
Then had the sons of God excuse to have been 
Enamoured at that sight but in those hearts 
Given him by this great conference to know 
Exceeded human and his wary speech 
Thus to the empyreal minister he framed 
Under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed 
As that more willingly thou couldst not seem 
To whom the winged Hierarch replied 
Proportioned to each kind  So from the root 
Fancy and understanding whence the soul 
And from these corporal nutriments perhaps 
Here or in heavenly Paradises dwell 
Whose progeny you are  Mean while enjoy 
Your fill what happiness this happy state 
To whom the patriarch of mankind replied 
Well hast thou taught the way that might direct 
Obedient  Can we want obedience then 
Who formed us from the dust and placed us here 
Full to the utmost measure of what bliss 
Human desires can seek or apprehend 
This was that caution given thee be advised 
He left it in thy power ordained thy will 
Not our necessitated such with him 
To love or not in this we stand or fall 
And so from Heaven to deepest Hell O fall 
To whom our great progenitor  Thy words 
Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills 
Aereal musick send  Nor knew I not 
To be both will and deed created free 
Yet that we never shall forget to love 
Worthy of sacred silence to be heard 
His other half in the great zone of Heaven 
Sad task and hard  For how shall I relate 
To human sense the invisible exploits 
The ruin of so many glorious once 
And perfect while they stood how last unfold 
Not lawful to reveal yet for thy good 
This is dispensed and what surmounts the reach 
As may express them best though what if Earth 
Upon her center poised when on a day 
Under their Hierarchs in orders bright 
Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed 
Recorded eminent  Thus when in orbs 
This day I have begot whom I declare 
At my right hand your head I him appoint 
Under his great vicegerent reign abide 
In song and dance about the sacred hill 
And in their motions harmony divine 
Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn 
Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled 
All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest 
Melodious hymns about the sovran throne 
Alternate all night long but not so waked 
Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour 
Contemptuous and his next subordinate 
Thy eyelids and rememberest what decree 
Both waking we were one how then can now 
Thy sleep dissent  New laws thou seest imposed 
What doubtful may ensue  More in this place 
To utter is not safe  Assemble thou 
Of all those myriads which we lead the chief 
The quarters of the north there to prepare 
Who speedily through all the hierarchies 
Bad influence into the unwary breast 
The great hierarchal standard was to move 
Or taint integrity  But all obeyed 
Of their great Potentate for great indeed 
And from within the golden lamps that burn 
Were banded to oppose his high decree 
Nearly it now concerns us to be sure 
We mean to hold what anciently we claim 
Of deity or empire  Such a foe 
In our defence lest unawares we lose 
Know whether I be dextrous to subdue 
Far was advanced on winged speed an host 
Impearls on every leaf and every flower 
In their triple degrees regions to which 
At length into the limits of the north 
They came and Satan to his royal seat 
That structure in the dialect of men 
In imitation of that mount whereon 
The Mountain of the Congregation called 
Pretending so commanded to consult 
Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears 
If these magnifick titles yet remain 
Another now hath to himself engrossed 
Receive him coming to receive from us 
But what if better counsels might erect 
Natives and sons of Heaven possessed before 
Equally free for orders and degrees 
Monarchy over such as live by right 
In freedom equal or can introduce 
Thus far his bold discourse without controul 
Had audience when among the Seraphim 
The current of his fury thus opposed 
Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven 
In place thyself so high above thy peers 
Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn 
One over all with unsucceeded power 
Shalt thou give law to God shalt thou dispute 
And of our good and of our dignity 
How provident he is how far from thought 
That equal over equals monarch reign 
But more illustrious made since he the head 
One of our number thus reduced becomes 
His laws our laws all honour to him done 
And tempt not these but hasten to appease 
While pardon may be found in time besought 
So spake the fervent Angel but his zeal 
Or singular and rash  Whereat rejoiced 
That we were formed then sayest thou and the work 
From Father to his Son strange point and new 
Doctrine which we would know whence learned who saw 
When this creation was rememberest thou 
We know no time when we were not as now 
Our puissance is our own our own right hand 
Who is our equal  Then thou shalt behold 
Whether by supplication we intend 
These tidings carry to the anointed King 
Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause 
Through the infinite host nor less for that 
Forsaken of all good  I see thy fall 
Both of thy crime and punishment  Henceforth 
No more be troubled how to quit the yoke 
Will not be now vouchsafed other decrees 
Against thee are gone forth without recall 
Is now an iron rod to bruise and break 
Thy disobedience  Well thou didst advise 
Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly 
Distinguish not  For soon expect to feel 
When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know 
On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed

Unbarred the gates of light  There is a cave 
Where light and darkness in perpetual round 
Seem twilight here  And now went forth the Morn 
Such as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold 
Shot through with orient beams when all the plain 
Already known what he for news had thought 
To have reported  Gladly then he mixed 
Returned not lost  On to the sacred hill 
Servant of God Well done well hast thou fought 
Against revolted multitudes the cause 
And for the testimony of truth hast borne 
Than violence for this was all thy care 
Judged thee perverse  The easier conquest now 
Than scorned thou didst depart and to subdue 
Equal in number to that Godless crew 
Rebellious  Them with fire and hostile arms 
His fiery Chaos to receive their fall 
Of wrath awaked nor with less dread the loud 
Heroick ardour to adventurous deeds 
Of God and his Messiah  On they move 
Their perfect ranks for high above the ground 
Their nimble tread as when the total kind 
Came summoned over Eden to receive 
Their names of thee so over many a tract 
Far in the horizon to the north appeared 
Bristled with upright beams innumerable 
The banded Powers of Satan hasting on 
With furious expedition for they weened 
Aspirer but their thoughts proved fond and vain 
In the mid way  Though strange to us it seemed 
So oft in festivals of joy and love 
Hymning the Eternal Father  But the shout 
Of onset ended soon each milder thought 
Presented stood in terrible array 
And thus his own undaunted heart explores 
O Heaven that such resemblance of the Highest 
Remain not  Wherefore should not strength and might 
Most reason is that reason overcome 
Or potent tongue  Foolnot to think how vain 
Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms 
Have raised incessant armies to defeat 
Thy folly or with solitary hand 
Thy legions under darkness  But thou seest 
Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent 
From all  My sect thou seestnow learn too late 
Omnipotence to none  But well thou comest 
At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven 
To heavenly souls had been all one but now 
As both their deeds compared this day shall prove 
To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied 
Unjustly thou depravest it with the name 
Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid 
This greeting on thy impious crest receive 
Such ruin intercept  Ten paces huge 
He back recoiled the tenth on bended knee 
His massy spear upstaid as if on earth 
Half sunk with all his pines  Amazement seised 
Of battle  Whereat Michael bid sound 
The ArchAngel trumpet through the vast of Heaven 
Hosanna to the Highest  Nor stood at gaze 
And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now 
Was never arms on armour clashing brayed 
Of brazen chariots raged dire was the noise 
Of conflict over head the dismal hiss 
And flying vaulted either host with fire 
So under fiery cope together rushed 
And inextinguishable rage  All Heaven 
Had to her center shook  What wonder when 
Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought 
Of all their regions  How much more of power 
Army against army numberless to raise 
And limited their might though numbered such 
As each divided legion might have seemed 
A numerous host in strength each armed hand 
As only in his arm the moment lay 
Of victory  Deeds of eternal fame 
That war and various sometimes on firm ground 
Tormented all the air all air seemed then 
Conflicting fire  Long time in even scale 
Squadrons at once with huge twohanded sway 
Widewasting such destruction to withstand 
A vast circumference  At his approach 
The great ArchAngel from his warlike toil 
And visage all inflamed first thus began 
And thy  adherents  How hast thou disturbed 
Of thy rebellion how hast thou instilled 
To trouble holy rest Heaven casts thee out 
Brooks not the works of violence and war 
Precipitate thee with augmented pain 
So spake the Prince of Angels to whom thus 
The Adversary  Nor think thou with wind 
Of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds 
Thou canst not  Hast thou turned the least of these 
Or turn this Heaven itself into the Hell 
Human imagination to such highth 
Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven 
Made horrid circles two broad suns their shields 
Together both with next to almighty arm 
As not of power at once nor odds appeared 
In might or swift prevention  But the sword 
Of Michael from the armoury of God 
Nor solid might resist that edge it met 
And writhed him to and fro convolved so sore 
The griding sword with discontinuous wound 
Not long divisible and from the gash 
A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed 
Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run 
From off the files of war  There they him laid 
His confidence to equal God in power 
Yet soon he healed for Spirits that live throughout 
Cannot but by annihilating die 
Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound 
Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved 
And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array 
And at his chariotwheels to drag him bound 
Refrained his tongue blasphemous but anon 
And uncouth pain fled bellowing  On each wing 
Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail 
Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy 
Eternize here on earth but those elect 
Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell 
And ignominy yet to glory aspires 
Therefore eternal silence be their doom 
With many an inroad gored deformed rout 
By sin of disobedience till that hour 
Such high advantages their innocence 
Not to have disobeyed in fight they stood 
And silence on the odious din of war 
Victor and vanquished  On the foughten field 
Michael and his Angels prevalent 
His potentates to council called by night 
And in the midst thus undismayed began 
Since now we find this our empyreal form 
Of evil then so small as easy think 
In nature none  If other hidden cause 
Due search and consultation will disclose 
He sat and in the assembly next upstood 
And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake 
Enjoyment of our right as Gods yet hard 
Ruin must needs ensue for what avails 
Of mightiest  Sense of pleasure we may well 
With what more forcible we may offend 
No less than for deliverance what we owe 
Whereto with look composed Satan replied 
Which of us who beholds the bright surface 
Whose eye so superficially surveys 
These in their dark nativity the deep 
The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt 
Effect shall end our wish  Mean while revive 
Abandon fear to strength and counsel joined 
To be the inventer missed so easy it seemed 
Like instrument to plague the sons of men 
Forthwith from council to the work they flew 
None arguing stood innumerable hands 
Were ready in a moment up they turned 
The originals of nature in their crude 
Conception sulphurous and nitrous foam 
Concocted and adusted they reduced 
Part hidden veins digged up nor hath this earth 
Whereof to found their engines and their balls 
Of missive ruin part incentive reed 
The matin trumpet sung  In arms they stood 
Soon banded others from the dawning hills 
In motion or in halt  Him soon they met 
But firm battalion back with speediest sail 
This day fear not his flightso thick a cloud 
But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire 
And onward moved embattled  When behold 
Not distant far with heavy pace the foe 
To hide the fraud  At interview both stood 
A while but suddenly at head appeared 
Our overture and turn not back perverse 
Had ended when to right and left the front 
A triple mounted row of pillars laid 
Portending hollow truce  At each behind 
Not long for sudden all at once their reeds 
By quick contraction or remove but now 
Nor served it to relax their serried files 
And to their foes a laughter for in view 
In posture to displode their second tire 
Of thunder  Back defeated to return 
And to his mates thus in derision called 
O Friends why come not on these victors proud 
To entertain them fair with open front 
As they would dance yet for a dance they seemed 
Somewhat extravagant and wild perhaps 
We should compel them to a quick result 
Had need from head to foot well understand 
They show us when our foes walk not upright 
So they among themselves in pleasant vein 
All doubt of victory  Eternal Might 
To match with their inventions they presumed 
A while in trouble  But they stood not long 
Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose 
Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed 
For Earth hath this variety from Heaven 
When coming towards them so dread they saw 
The bottom of the mountains upward turned 
Under the weight of mountains buried deep 
Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire 
That under ground they fought in dismal shade 
Infernal noise war seemed a civil game 
To this uproar horrid confusion heaped 
Upon confusion rose  And now all Heaven 
To honour his anointed Son avenged 
Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame 
Save what sin hath impaired which yet hath wrought 
Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last 
And to disordered rage let loose the reins 
For thee I have ordained it and thus far 
Can end it  Into thee such virtue and grace 
In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare 
To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir 
Shone full he all his Father full expressed 
Ineffably into his face received 
And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake 
For ever and in me all whom thou lovest 
Whom to obey is happiness entire 
From the right hand of Glory where he sat 
Dawning through Heaven  Forth rushed with whirlwind sound 
By four Cherubick shapes four faces each 
And wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels 
Ascended at his right hand Victory 
Sat eaglewinged beside him hung his bow 
And quiver with threebolted thunder stored 
And from about him fierce effusion rolled 
He onward came far off his coming shone 
And twenty thousand I their number heard 
He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime 
Illustrious far and wide but by his own 
When the great ensign of Messiah blazed 
Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced 
Under their Head imbodied all in one 
Before him Power Divine his way prepared 
At his command the uprooted hills retired 
And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled 
In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell 
Or wonders move the obdurate to relent 
In universal ruin last and now 
Or faint retreat when the great Son of God 
To all his host on either hand thus spake 
Ye Angels armed this day from battle rest 
Invincibly  But of this cursed crew 
The punishment to other hand belongs 
Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned 
Or I alone against them since by strength 
Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe 
And full of wrath bent on his enemies 
At once the Four spread out their starry wings 
Gloomy as night under his burning wheels 
All but the throne itself of God  Full soon 
Among them he arrived in his right hand 
All courage down their idle weapons dropt 
That wished the mountains now might be again 
Nor less on either side tempestuous fell 
Distinct alike with multitude of eyes 
One Spirit in them ruled and every eye 
His thunder in mid volley for he meant 
Of goats or timorous flock together thronged 
Into the wasteful deep  The monstrous sight 
Urged them behind  Headlong themselves they threw 
Down from the verge of Heaven eternal wrath 
Burnt after them to the bottomless pit 
Affrighted but strict Fate had cast too deep 
And felt tenfold confusion in their fall 
Incumbered him with ruin  Hell at last 
Messiah his triumphal chariot turned 
And temple of his Mighty Father throned 
Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss 
What might have else to human race been hid 
Who now is plotting how he may seduce 
Thee once to gain companion of his woe

Above the flight of Pegasean wing 
With thy celestial song  Up led by thee 
Thy tempering with like safety guided down 
Return me to my native element 
Within the visible diurnal sphere 
But drive far off the barbarous dissonance 
Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard 
Both harp and voice nor could the Muse defend 
To those apostates lest the like befall 
So easily obeyed amid the choice 
From whom it sprung impossible to mix 
With blessedness  Whence Adam soon repealed 
The doubts that in his heart arose and now 
Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began 
Before his memory as one whose drouth 
Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest 
Divine interpreter by favour sent 
For which to the infinitely Good we owe 
Of what we are  But since thou hast vouchsafed 
How first began this Heaven which we behold 
Innumerable and this which yields or fills 
Embracing round this floried Earth what cause 
Absolved if unforbid thou mayest unfold 
And the great light of day yet wants to run 
And longer will delay to hear thee tell 
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep 
Or if the star of evening and the moon 
Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought 
And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild 
Obtain though to recount almighty works 
Or heart of man suffice to comprehend 
Thy hearing such commission from above 
To ask nor let thine own inventions hope 
To none communicable in Earth or Heaven 
Enough is left besides to search and know 
In measure what the mind may well contain 
Fell with his flaming legions through the deep 
Eternal Father from his throne beheld 
Number sufficient to possess her realms 
Selflost and in a moment will create 
They open to themselves at length the way 
My overshadowing Spirit and Might with thee 
Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth 
So told as earthly notion can receive 
Had driven out the ungodly from his sight 
And the habitations of the just to Him 
Good out of evil to create instead 
His good to worlds and ages infinite 
So sang the Hierarchies  Mean while the Son 
Of Majesty Divine sapience and love 
About his chariot numberless were poured 
From the armoury of God where stand of old 
Celestial equipage and now came forth 
Attendant on their Lord  Heaven opened wide 
On heavenly ground they stood and from the shore 
They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss 
Up from the bottom turned by furious winds 
Said then the Omnifick Word your discord end 
For Chaos heard his voice  Him all his train 
Round through the vast profundity obscure 
Matter unformed and void  Darkness profound 
Covered the abyss but on the watery calm 
Throughout the fluid mass but downward purged 
Like things to like the rest to several place 
And Earth selfbalanced on her center hung 
Sprung from the deep and from her native east 
Was not she in a cloudy tabernacle 
Sojourned the while  God saw the light was good 
And light from darkness by the hemisphere 
He named  Thus was the first day even and morn 
Exhaling first from darkness they beheld 
Birthday of Heaven and Earth with joy and shout 
The waters from the waters and God made 
In circuit to the uttermost convex 
The waters underneath from those above 
Of Chaos far removed lest fierce extremes 
Contiguous might distemper the whole frame 
And Heaven he named the Firmament  So even 
And morning chorus sung the second day 
Appeared not over all the face of Earth 
Be gathered now ye waters under Heaven 
Immediately the mountains huge appear 
Into the clouds their tops ascend the sky 
Capacious bed of waters  Thither they 
As drops on dust conglobing from the dry 
For haste such flight the great command impressed 
On the swift floods  As armies at the call 
Of trumpet for of armies thou hast heard 
Softebbing nor withstood them rock or hill 
And on the washy oose deep channels wore 
Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth 
Her universal face with pleasant green 
And bush with frizzled hair implicit  Last 
Their blossoms  With high woods the hills were crowned 
With borders long the rivers that Earth now 
Her sacred shades though God had yet not rained 
None was but from the Earth a dewy mist 
On the green stem  God saw that it was good 
So even and morn recorded the third day 
To give light on the Earth and it was so 
And set them in the firmament of Heaven 
For of celestial bodies first the sun 
Though of ethereal mould then formed the moon 
And drink the liquid light firm to retain 
And hence the morningplanet gilds her horns 
By tincture or reflection they augment 
From him for other light she needed none 
Spangling the hemisphere  Then first adorned 
Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day 
Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven 
The waters generated by their kinds 
And every bird of wing after his kind 
Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold 
Moist nutriment or under rocks their food 
In jointed armour watch on smooth the seal 
And bended dolphins play part huge of bulk 
And seems a moving land and at his gills 
Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed 
Their callow young but feathered soon and fledge 
In prospect there the eagle and the stork 
On cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build 
Easing their flight so steers the prudent crane 
From branch to branch the smaller birds with song 
Till even nor then the solemn nightingale 
Her state with oary feet yet oft they quit 
The mid aereal sky  Others on ground 
Walked firm the crested cock whose clarion sounds 
Of rainbows and starry eyes  The waters thus 
Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day 
Opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth 
The cattle in the fields and meadows green 
The grassy clods now calved now half appeared 
In hillocks  The swift stag from under ground 
Bore up his branching head  Scarce from his mould 
Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved 
As plants  Ambiguous between sea and land 
Insect or worm those waved their limber fans 
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace not all 
Of future in small room large heart enclosed 
Pattern of just equality perhaps 
Of commonalty  Swarming next appeared 
Needless to thee repeated nor unknown 
First wheeled their course  Earth in her rich attire 
Frequent and of the sixth day yet remained 
But grateful to acknowledge whence his good 
Of all his works  therefore the Omnipotent 
Eternal Father for where is not he 
Present thus to his Son audibly spake 
And every creeping thing that creeps the ground 
The breath of life in his own image he 
Express and thou becamest a living soul 
Male he created thee but thy consort 
And every living thing that moves on the Earth 
Delectable both to behold and taste 
And freely all their pleasant fruit for food 
And govern well thy appetite lest Sin 
So even and morn accomplished the sixth day 
Yet not till the Creator from his work 
Answering his great idea  Up he rode 
While the bright pomp ascended jubilant 
The great Creator from his work returned 
Delighted and with frequent intercourse 
Thither will send his winged messengers 
On errands of supernal grace  So sung 
Powdered with stars  And now on Earth the seventh 
Forerunning night when at the holy mount 
With his great Father for he also went 
But not in silence holy kept the harp 
Creation and the six days acts they sung 
Relate thee  Greater now in thy return 
Than from the giant Angels  Thee that day 
Thy thunders magnified but to create 
Is greater than created to destroy 
Thy empire  Easily the proud attempt 
Thou hast repelled while impiously they thought 
The number of thy worshippers  Who seeks 
To manifest the more thy might his evil 
Of destined habitation but thou knowest 
And worship him and in reward to rule 
And multiply a race of worshippers 
With halleluiahs  Thus was sabbath kept 
And what before thy memory was done 
 
 
 
Book VIII                                                        
 
 
This friendly condescension to relate 
With glory attributed to the high 
Which only thy solution can resolve 
Of Heaven and Earth consisting and compute 
One day and night in all her vast survey 
How Nature wise and frugal could commit 
Such restless revolution day by day 
Entering on studious thoughts abstruse which Eve 
Her husband the relater she preferred 
With conjugal caresses from his lip 
Not words alone pleased her  O when meet now 
And from about her shot darts of desire 
Benevolent and facile thus replied 
From Man or Angel the great Architect 
His secrets to be scanned by them who ought 
His laughter at their quaint opinions wide 
Hereafter when they come to model Heaven 
To save appearances how gird the sphere 
That bodies bright and greater should not serve 
Or bright infers not excellence the Earth 
More plenty than the sun that barren shines 
Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries 
That Man may know he dwells not in his own 
Lodged in a small partition and the rest 
Ordained for uses to his Lord best known 
That to corporeal substances could add 
Who since the morninghour set out from Heaven 
In Eden distance inexpressible 
Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved 
To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth 
And no advantage gain  What if the sun 
By his attractive virtue and their own 
In six thou seest and what if seventh to these 
Insensibly three different motions move 
Moved contrary with thwart obliquities 
Fields and inhabitants  Her spots thou seest 
Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat 
Communicating male and female light 
Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live 
For such vast room in Nature unpossessed 
Rise on the earth or earth rise on the sun 
He from the east his flaming road begin 
With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps 
And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along 
Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid 
And thy fair Eve Heaven is for thee too high 
To know what passes there be lowly wise 
Contented that thus far hath been revealed 
The easiest way nor with perplexing thoughts 
And not molest us unless we ourselves 
But apt the mind or fancy is to rove 
Therefore from this high pitch let us descend 
Thee I have heard relating what was done 
And day is not yet spent till then thou seest 
How subtly to detain thee I devise 
Inviting thee to hear while I relate 
Fond were it not in hope of thy reply 
And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear 
Than fruits of palmtree pleasantest to thirst 
To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek 
Nor tongue ineloquent for God on thee 
Abundantly his gifts hath also poured 
Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth 
Gladly into the ways of God with Man 
On Man his equal love  Say therefore on 
Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell 
Squared in full legion such command we had 
Destruction with creation might have mixed 
Not that they durst without his leave attempt 
But us he sends upon his high behests 
But long ere our approaching heard within 
Glad we returned up to the coasts of light 
Ere sabbathevening so we had in charge 
Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine 
For Man to tell how human life began 
Is hard for who himself beginning knew 
Desire with thee still longer to converse 
In balmy sweat which with his beams the sun 
Stood on my feet about me round I saw 
Birds on the branches warbling all things smiled 
In goodness and in power preeminent 
And feel that I am happier than I know 
Pensive I sat me down  There gentle sleep 
I then was passing to my former state 
Whose inward apparition gently moved 
Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye 
Had lively shadowed  Here had new begun 
In adoration at his feet I fell 
Not to incur but soon his clear aspect 
Approaching two and two these cowering low 
With blandishment each bird stooped on his wing 
My sudden apprehension  But in these 
I found not what methought I wanted still 
And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed 
Surpassest far my naming how may I 
And all this good to man for whose well being 
Thou hast provided all things  But with me 
I see not who partakes  In solitude 
What callest thou solitude  Is not the Earth 
To come and play before thee  Knowest thou not 
And reason not contemptibly  With these 
And these inferiour far beneath me set 
Among unequals what society 
Tedious alike  Of fellowship I speak 
All rational delight wherein the brute 
Cannot be human consort  They rejoice 
So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined 
Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed 
From all eternity for none I know 
Beneath what other creatures are to thee 
He ceased I lowly answered  To attain 
The highth and depth of thy eternal ways 
But in degree the cause of his desire 
By conversation with his like to help 
Or solace his defects  No need that thou 
But Man by number is to manifest 
In unity defective which requires 
Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt 
From prone nor in their ways complacence find 
This answer from the gracious Voice Divine 
Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee 
Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike 
Knew it not good for Man to be alone 
And no such company as then thou sawest 
To see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet 
As with an object that excels the sense 
Still glorious before whom awake I stood 
But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed 
The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands 
And in her looks which from that time infused 
And into all things from her air inspired 
The spirit of love and amorous delight 
With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow 
And guided by his voice nor uninformed 
In every gesture dignity and love 
This turn hath made amends thou hast fulfilled 
Giver of all things fair but fairest this 
Of all thy gifts nor enviest  I now see 
Before me  Woman is her nameof Man 
Extracted for this cause he shall forego 
And with obsequious majesty approved 
My pleaded reason  To the nuptial bower 
Shed their selectest influence the Earth 
Joyous the birds fresh gales and gentle airs 
Which I enjoy and must confess to find 
Nor vehement desire these delicacies 
Commotion strange in all enjoyments else 
Superiour and unmoved here only weak 
Not proof enough such object to sustain 
More than enough at least on her bestowed 
For well I understand in the prime end 
In outward also her resembling less 
The character of that dominion given 
All higher knowledge in her presence falls 
Degraded  Wisdom in discourse with her 
Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat 
To whom the Angel with contracted brow 
Do thou but thine and be not diffident 
By attributing overmuch to things 
Not thy subjection  Weigh with her thyself 
Then value  Ofttimes nothing profits more 
And to realities yield all her shows 
Beyond all other think the same vouchsafed 
To cattle and each beast which would not be 
Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue 
What higher in her society thou findest 
Wherein true love consists not  Love refines 
Among the beasts no mate for thee was found 
From all her words and actions mixed with love 
Harmony to behold in wedded pair 
More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear 
Yet these subject not I to thee disclose 
Express they by looks only or do they mix 
Answered  Let it suffice thee that thou knowest 
And pure thou wert created we enjoy 
In eminence and obstacle find none 
But I can now no more the parting sun 
His great command take heed lest passion sway 
The weal or woe in thee is placed beware 
And all the Blest  Stand fastto stand or fall 
Free in thine own arbitrement it lies 
And all temptation to transgress repel 
Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore 
Gentle to me and affable hath been 
With grateful memory  Thou to mankind 
So parted they the Angel up to Heaven

No more of talk where God or Angel guest 
Rural repast permitting him the while 
And disobedience on the part of Heaven 
Not less but more heroick than the wrath 
Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued 
Thrice fugitive about Troy wall or rage 
 
   00482129  
If answerable style I can obtain 
And dictates to me slumbering or inspires 
Easy my unpremeditated verse 
Since first this subject for heroick song 
Not sedulous by nature to indite 
With long and tedious havock fabled knights 
Of patience and heroick martyrdom 
Not that which justly gives heroick name 
Remains sufficient of itself to raise 
The space of seven continued nights he rode 
With darkness thrice the equinoctial line 
He circled four times crossed the car of night 
Rose up a fountain by the tree of life 
From Eden over Pontus and the pool 
West from Orontes to the ocean barred 
At Darien  thence to the land where flows 
Ganges and Indus Thus the orb he roamed 
With narrow search and with inspection deep 
Most opportune might serve his wiles and found 
The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field 
As from his wit and native subtlety 
Doubt might beget of diabolick power 
His bursting passion into plaints thus poured 
In thee concentring all their precious beams 
Of sacred influence  As God in Heaven 
Of creatures animate with gradual life 
Find place or refuge and the more I see 
Of contraries all good to me becomes 
Nor hope to be myself less miserable 
For only in destroying I find ease 
In woe then that destruction wide may range 
To me shall be the glory sole among 
Continued making and who knows how long 
Before had been contriving though perhaps 
From servitude inglorious well nigh half 
Whether such virtue spent of old now failed 
Determined to advance into our room 
And flaming ministers to watch and tend 
Their earthly charge Of these the vigilance 
The serpent sleeping in whose mazy folds 
That to the highth of Deity aspired 
But what will not ambition and revenge 
From dust Spite then with spite is best repaid 
The serpent him fastsleeping soon he found 
Fearless unfeared he slept in at his mouth 
With act intelligential but his sleep 
And joined their vocal worship to the quire 
The season prime for sweetest scents and airs 
Their growing work for much their work outgrew 
And Eve first to her husband thus began 
Luxurious by restraint what we by day 
One night or two with wanton growth derides 
Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present 
In yonder spring of roses intermixed 
Casual discourse draw on which intermits 
To whom mild answer Adam thus returned 
Compare above all living creatures dear 
How we might best fulfil the work which here 
God hath assigned us nor of me shalt pass 
Unpraised for nothing lovelier can be found 
And good works in her husband to promote 
Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed 
These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands 
And short retirement urges sweet return 
Befall thee severed from me for thou knowest 
By sly assault and somewhere nigh at hand 
To other speedy aid might lend at need 
Whether his first design be to withdraw 
Enjoyed by us excites his envy more 
With sweet austere composure thus replied 
Just then returned at shut of evening flowers 
His fraud is then thy fear which plain infers 
Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced 
To whom with healing words Adam replied 
For such thou art from sin and blame entire 
Not diffident of thee do I dissuade 
The tempted with dishonour foul supposed 
Against temptation Thou thyself with scorn 
If such affront I labour to avert 
Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn 
Access in every virtue in thy sight 
Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel 
So spake domestick Adam in his care 
Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed 
Of our integrity his foul esteem 
Foul on himself then wherefore shunned or feared 
By us who rather double honour gain 
Let us not then suspect our happy state 
As not secure to single or combined 
To whom thus Adam fervently replied 
Of God ordained them His creating hand 
Nothing imperfect or deficient left 
Secure from outward force within himself 
Against his will he can receive no harm 
But God left free the will for what obeys 
She dictate false and misinform the will 
To do what God expressly hath forbid 
That I should mind thee oft and mind thou me 
Since Reason not impossibly may meet 
Thou sever not Trial will come unsought 
On what thou hast of virtue summon all 
So spake the patriarch of mankind but Eve 
Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words 
A foe so proud will first the weaker seek 
Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove 
Her long with ardent look his eye pursued 
Oft he to her his charge of quick return 
Repeated she to him as oft engaged 
And all things in best order to invite 
Of thy presumed return event perverse 
Thou never from that hour in Paradise 
Waited with hellish rancour imminent 
By fountain or by shady rivulet 
Hung drooping unsustained them she upstays 
Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned 
Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse 
Among the pleasant villages and farms 
Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold 
His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought 
That space the Evilone abstracted stood 
Save what is in destroying other joy 
Occasion which now smiles behold alone 
The way which to her ruin now I tend 
Floated redundant pleasing was his shape 
And lovely never since of serpentkind 
In Epidaurus nor to which transformed 
He with Olympias this with her who bore 
Than at Circean call the herd disguised 
But as in gaze admiring oft he bowed 
Fawning and licked the ground whereon she trod 
His gentle dumb expression turned at length 
His fraudulent temptation thus began 
Insatiate I thus singlenor have feared 
Where universally admired but here 
Who sees thee and what is one who should be seen 
What may this mean language of man pronounced 
Created mute to all articulate sound 
The latter I demur for in their looks 
To me so friendly grown above the rest 
To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied 
Easy to me it is to tell thee all 
What thou commandest and right thou shouldst be obeyed 
I was at first as other beasts that graze 
As was my food nor aught but food discerned 
A goodly tree far distant to behold 
Ruddy and gold I nearer drew to gaze 
To satisfy the sharp desire I had 
About the mossy trunk I wound me soon 
Of reason in my inward powers and speech 
Wanted not long though to this shape retained 
Thenceforth to speculations high or deep 
But all that fair and good in thy divine 
United I beheld no fair to thine 
Equivalent or second which compelled 
For many are the trees of God that grow 
Help to disburden Nature of her birth 
Of blowing myrrh and balm if thou accept 
Misleads the amazed nightwanderer from his way 
The credit of whose virtue rest with thee 
But of this tree we may not taste nor touch 
Law to ourselves our reason is our law 
To whom the Tempter guilefully replied 
Indeed hath God then said that of the fruit 
Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air 
Of each tree in the garden we may eat 
But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst 
Mother of science now I feel thy power 
Within me clear not only to discern 
Queen of this universe do not believe 
Those rigid threats of death ye shall not die 
How should you by the fruit it gives you life 
And life more perfect have attained than Fate 
Is open or will God incense his ire 
For such a petty trespass and not praise 
Deterred not from achieving what might lead 
Your fear itself of death removes the fear 
His worshippers  He knows that in the day 
Wisdom without their leave and wherein lies 
Or is it envy and can envy dwell 
Causes import your need of this fair fruit 
Into her heart too easy entrance won 
Might tempt alone and in her ears the sound 
Solicited her longing eye yet first 
The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise 
Forbids us then to taste but his forbidding 
Our inward freedom  In the day we eat 
Irrational till then  For us alone 
Was death invented or to us denied 
For beasts it seems yet that one beast which first 
Of virtue to make wise  What hinders then 
That all was lost  Back to the thicket slunk 
Of knowledge not was Godhead from her thought 
Thus to herself she pleasingly began 
In Paradise of operation blest 
Of thy full branches offered free to all 
Though others envy what they cannot give 
Each thing on Earth and other care perhaps 
May have diverted from continual watch 
About him  But to Adam in what sort 
Shall I appear shall I to him make known 
But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power 
Without copartner so to add what wants 
And death ensue then I shall be no more 
Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe 
As reapers oft are wont their harvestqueen 
Misgave him he the faltering measure felt 
That morn when first they parted by the tree 
Scarce from the tree returning in her hand 
To him she hasted in her face excuse 
Thy presence agony of love till now 
The pain of absence from thy sight  But strange 
Reasoning to admiration and with me 
And growing up to Godhead which for thee 
Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told 
But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed 
From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve 
First to himself he inward silence broke 
The sacred fruit forbidden  Some cursed fraud 
And me with thee hath ruined for with thee 
Certain my resolution is to die 
How can I live without thee how forego 
To live again in these wild woods forlorn 
Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned 
Had it been only coveting to eye 
Much more to taste it under ban to touch 
Nor yet on him found deadly yet he lives 
Higher degree of life inducement strong 
Proportional ascent which cannot be 
Certain to undergo like doom  If death 
So forcible within my heart I feel 
The bond of Nature draw me to my own 
One flesh to lose thee were to lose myself 
So Adam and thus Eve to him replied 
So eminently never had been known 
Were it I thought death menaced would ensue 
Pernicious to thy peace chiefly assured 
And fear of death deliver to the winds 
In recompence for such compliance bad 
Such recompence best merits from the bough 
She gave him of that fair enticing fruit 
But fondly overcome with female charm 
In pangs and Nature gave a second groan 
Wept at completing of the mortal sin 
Eating his fill nor Eve to iterate 
Wherewith to scorn the earth  But that false fruit 
Carnal desire inflaming he on Eve 
Began to cast lascivious eyes she him 
As wantonly repaid in lust they burn 
And palate call judicious I the praise 
For this one tree had been forbidden ten 
Than ever bounty of this virtuous tree 
Of amorous intent well understood 
The solace of their sin till dewy sleep 
That with exhilarating vapour bland 
Shorn of his strength  They destitute and bare 
At length gave utterance to these words constrained 
False in our promised rising since our eyes 
And in our faces evident the signs 
Of foul concupiscence whence evil store 
Be sure thenHow shall I behold the face 
And rapture so oft beheld  Those heavenly shapes 
Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze 
Insufferably bright  O might I here 
In solitude live savage in some glade 
What best may for the present serve to hide 
Into the thickest wood there soon they chose 
In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms 
At loopholes cut through thickest shade  Those leaves 
To that first naked glory  Such of late 
Among the trees on isles and woody shores 
They sat them down to weep nor only tears 
Heard not her lore both in subjection now 
Usurping over sovran Reason claimed 
Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed 
I know not whence possessed thee we had then 
Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve 
The faith they owe when earnestly they seek 
Was I to have never parted from thy side 
As good have grown there still a lifeless rib 
Yet willingly chose rather death with thee 
And am I now upbraided as the cause 
And force upon free will hath here no place 
But confidence then bore thee on secure 
Matter of glorious trial and perhaps 
No evil durst attempt thee but I rue 
And thou the accuser  Thus it shall befall 
Lets her will rule restraint she will not brook 
She first his weak indulgence will accuse 
Thus they in mutual accusation spent 
And of their vain contest appeared no end

Mean while the heinous and despiteful act 
Hindered not Satan to attempt the mind 
Complete to have discovered and repulsed 
Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend 
Incurred what could they less the penalty 
Up into Heaven from Paradise in haste 
Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen 
Entrance unseen  Soon as the unwelcome news 
All were who heard dim sadness did not spare 
And easily approved when the Most High 
Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice 
Which your sincerest care could not prevent 
When first this tempter crossed the gulf from Hell 
Against his Maker no decree of mine 
Or touch with lightest moment of impulse 
In even scale  But fallen he is and now 
By some immediate stroke but soon shall find 
Justice shall not return as bounty scorned 
Vicegerent Son  To thee I have transferred 
Easy it may be seen that I intend 
And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen 
Blazed forth unclouded Deity He full 
Resplendent all his Father manifest 
Mayest ever rest well pleased  I go to judge 
When time shall be for so I undertook 
On me derived yet I shall temper so 
Conviction to the serpent none belongs 
Accompanied to Heavengate from whence 
Down he descended straight the speed of Gods 
Now was the sun in western cadence low 
To sentence Man  The voice of God they heard 
And from his presence hid themselves among 
Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought 
The gracious Judge without revile replied 
But still rejoiced how is it now become 
Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat 
To whom thus Adam sore beset replied 
O Heaven in evil strait this day I stand 
Before my Judge either to undergo 
By my complaint but strict necessity 
Wouldst easily detect what I conceal 
Her doing seemed to justify the deed 
To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied 
Hers in all real dignity  Adorned 
Unseemly to bear rule which was thy part 
To judgement he proceeded on the accused 
As vitiated in nature  More to know 
Nor altered his offence yet God at last 
And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall 
And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life 
Between thee and the woman I will put 
Whom he shall tread at last under our feet 
And to the Woman thus his sentence turned 
Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply 
By thy conception children thou shalt bring 
Thine shall submit he over thee shall rule 
On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced 
Cursed is the ground for thy sake thou in sorrow 
Thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth 
Unbid and thou shalt eat the herb of the field 
Till thou return unto the ground for thou 
Thenceforth the form of servant to assume 
Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid 
And thought not much to clothe his enemies 
Nor he their outward only with the skins 
Into his blissful bosom reassumed 
Sin opening who thus now to Death began 
By his avengers since no place like this 
For Death from Sin no power can separate 
Stay his return perhaps over this gulf 
Where Satan now prevails a monument 
By this newfelt attraction and instinct 
Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon 
The savour of death from all things there that live 
Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest 
Of mortal change on earth  As when a flock 
With scent of living carcasses designed 
His nostril wide into the murky air 
Sagacious of his quarry from so far 
Flew diverse and with power their power was great 
From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell 
Cathaian coast  The aggregated soil 
Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move 
Deep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach 
And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves 
Now had they brought the work by wonderous art 
Of Satan to the selfsame place where he 
Of this round world  With pins of adamant 
And durable  And now in little space 
With long reach interposed three several ways 
Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering 
Disguised he came but those his children dear 
Upon her husband saw their shame that sought 
Vain covertures but when he saw descend 
Thence gathered his own doom which understood 
Of that stupendious bridge his joy encreased 
Thy trophies which thou viewest as not thine own 
Such fatal consequence unites us three 
Nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure 
Detain from following thy illustrious track 
Within Hellgates till now thou us impowered 
Thine now is all this world thy virtue hath won 
What thy hands builded not thy wisdom gained 
As battle hath adjudged from this new world 
And henceforth monarchy with thee divide 
Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne 
Whom thus the Prince of darkness answered glad 
High proof ye now have given to be the race 
Issuing from me on your joint vigour now 
Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit 
So saying he dismissed them they with speed 
Then suffered  The other way Satan went down 
The causey to Hellgate  On either side 
Flown to the upper world the rest were all 
Of Pandemonium city and proud seat 
Of that bright star to Satan paragoned 
Might intercept their emperour sent so he 
Round their metropolis and now expecting 
In show plebeian Angel militant 
Was placed in regal lustre  Down a while 
With what permissive glory since his fall 
At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng 
Their mighty Chief returned loud was the acclaim 
Congratulant approached him who with hand 
Triumphant out of this infernal pit 
With peril great achieved  Long were to tell 
What I have done what sufferedwith what pain 
Of horrible confusion over which 
To expedite your glorious march but I 
Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wild 
Protesting Fate supreme thence how I found 
Of absolute perfection therein Man 
Made happy  Him by fraud I have seduced 
Is enmity which he will put between 
Me and mankind I am to bruise his heel 
Or much more grievous painYe have the account 
His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare 
His arms clung to his ribs his legs entwining 
But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue 
To forked tongue for now were all transformed 
To his bold riot  Dreadful was the din 
And Dipsas not so thick swarmed once the soil 
Above the rest still to retain they all 
Sublime with expectation when to see 
In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief 
Down fell both spear and shield down they as fast 
Cast on themselves from their own mouths  There stood 
Used by the Tempter on that prospect strange 
For one forbidden tree a multitude 
That curled Megaera greedily they plucked 
Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed 
With soot and cinders filled so oft they fell 
Whom they triumphed once lapsed  Thus were they plagued 
Of high Olympus thence by Saturn driven 
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair 
On his pale horse to whom Sin thus began 
Whom thus the Sinborn monster answered soon 
To whom the incestuous mother thus replied 
And season him thy last and sweetest prey 
To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice 
So fair and good created and had still 
Folly to me so doth the Prince of Hell 
I suffer them to enter and possess 
At random yielded up to their misrule 
Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure 
Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works 
Or down from Heaven descendSuch was their song 
As sorted best with present things  The sun 
As might affect the earth with cold and heat 
Scarce tolerable and from the north to call 
Decrepit winter from the south to bring 
Her office they prescribed to the other five 
In synod unbenign and taught the fixed 
Should prove tempestuous  To the winds they set 
With terrour through the dark aereal hall 
Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road 
Like distant breadth to Taurus with the seven 
Up to the Tropick Crab thence down amain 
As deep as Capricorn to bring in change 
Of seasons to each clime else had the spring 
Beyond the polar circles to them day 
Or east or west which had forbid the snow 
Beneath Magellan  At that tasted fruit 
Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat 
Corrupt and pestilent  Now from the north 
With adverse blast upturns them from the south 
Sirocco and Libecchio  Thus began 
Devoured each other nor stood much in awe 
Glared on him passing  These were from without 
Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint 
O miserable of happy  Is this the end 
My own deservings but this will not serve 
For this we may thank Adam but his thanks 
Shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound 
To mould me Man did I solicit thee 
In this delicious garden  As my will 
And equal to reduce me to my dust 
Desirous to resign and render back 
All I received unable to perform 
The sense of endless woes  Inexplicable 
To deathless pain  How gladly would I meet 
Insensible  How glad would lay me down 
And sleep secure his dreadful voice no more 
Would thunder in my ears no fear of worse 
With cruel expectation  Yet one doubt 
But I shall die a living death  O thought 
Of life that sinned what dies but what had life 
All of me then shall die let this appease 
But mortal doomed  How can he exercise 
Can he make deathless death  That were to make 
Impossible is held as argument 
Satisfied never  That were to extend 
Not to the extent of their own sphere  But say 
From this day onward which I feel begun 
To perpetuityAy methat fear 
Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution 
On my defenceless head both Death and I 
Nor I on my part single in me all 
Posterity stands cursed  Fair patrimony 
But all corrupt both mind and will depraved 
With me  How can they then acquitted stand 
But to my own conviction first and last 
So might the wrath  Fond wishcouldst thou support 
Beyond all past example and future 
To Satan only like both crime and doom 
O Conscience into what abyss of fears 
And horrours hast thou driven me out of which 
Which to his evil conscience represented 
All things with double terrour  On the ground 
Cursed his creation  Death as oft accused 
Justice Divine not hasten to be just 
But Death comes not at call Justice Divine 
With other echo late I taught your shades 
Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed 
But her with stern regard he thus repelled 
Thy inward fraud to warn all creatures from thee 
I had persisted happy had not thy pride 
Though by the Devil himself him overweening 
Rather than solid virtue all but a rib 
Or find some other way to generate 
And more that shall befall innumerable 
And strait conjunction with this sex for either 
Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain 
By parents or his happiest choice too late 
Which infinite calamity shall cause 
Unhappily deceived  Thy suppliant 
That cruel Serpent  On me exercise not 
Thy hatred for this misery befallen 
More miserable  Both have sinnedbut thou 
Against God only I against God and thee 
There with my cries importune Heaven that all 
Commiseration  Soon his heart relented 
Now at his feet submissive in distress 
And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon 
The punishment all on thyself alas 
And my displeasure bearest so ill  If prayers 
That on my head all might be visited 
And to our seed O hapless seed derived 
Found so erroneous thence by just event 
By Death at last and miserable it is 
That after wretched life must be at last 
Food for so foul a monster in thy power 
Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw 
Before the present object languishing 
With like desire which would be misery 
And torment less than none of what we dread 
With our own hands his office on ourselves 
Destruction with destruction to destroy  
Broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts 
To better hopes his more attentive mind 
Labouring had raised and thus to Eve replied 
To argue in thee something more sublime 
For loss of life and pleasure overloved 
The penalty pronounced doubt not but God 
Of contumacy will provoke the Highest 
To make death in us live  Then let us seek 
Against us this deceit  To crush his head 
Would be revenge indeed which will be lost 
Instead shall double ours upon our heads 
No more be mentioned then of violence 
That cuts us off from hope and savours only 
Reluctance against God and his just yoke 
Laid on our necks  Remember with what mild 
Without wrath or reviling we expected 
Was meant by death that day when loto thee 
Fruit of thy womb  On me the curse aslope 
Glanced on the ground with labour I must earn 
My bread what harm Idleness had been worse 
And teach us further by what means to shun 
To show us in this mountain while the winds 
Of these fair spreading trees which bids us seek 
Reflected may with matter sere foment 
The air attrite to fire as late the clouds 
Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine 
And what may else be remedy or cure 
Beseeching him so as we need not fear 
Before him reverent and there confess 
 
 
 
Book XI                                                          
 
 
So spake our father penitent nor Eve 
Before him reverent and both confessed 
Praying for from the mercyseat above 
Prevenient grace descending had removed 
Regenerate grow instead that sighs now breathed 
Unutterable which the Spirit of prayer 
Than loudest oratory  Yet their port 
Not of mean suitors nor important less 
Of Themis stood devout  To Heaven their prayers 
Blown vagabond or frustrate in they passed 
Dimensionless through heavenly doors then clad 
From thy implanted grace in Man these sighs 
The smell of peace toward mankind let him live 
To better life shall yield him where with me 
All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss 
Obtain all thy request was my decree 
The law I gave to Nature him forbids 
And mortal food as may dispose him best 
This other served but to eternize woe 
Till I provided death so death becomes 
Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed 
To the bright minister that watched he blew 
To sound at general doom  The angelick blast 
Filled all the regions from their blisful bowers 
And took their seats till from his throne supreme 
The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will 
Of that defended fruit but let him boast 
Happier had it sufficed him to have known 
Selfleft  Lest therefore his now bolder hand 
And send him from the garden forth to till 
Take to thee from among the Cherubim 
Without remorse drive out the sinful pair 
From hallowed ground the unholy and denounce 
Dismiss them not disconsolate reveal 
As I shall thee enlighten intermix 
Cherubick watch and of a sword the flame 
And guard all passage to the tree of life 
Lest Paradise a receptacle prove 
With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude 
He ceased and the archangelick Power prepared 
For swift descent with him the cohort bright 
Of watchful Cherubim four faces each 
Spangled with eyes more numerous than those 
Leucothea waked and with fresh dews imbalmed 
The earth when Adam and first matron Eve 
Strength added from above new hope to spring 
Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed 
The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends 
So prevalent as to concern the mind 
Hard to belief may seem yet this will prayer 
Even to the seat of God  For since I sought 
By prayer the offended Deity to appease 
Bending his ear persuasion in me grew 
That I was heard with favour peace returned 
Assures me that the bitterness of death 
Man is to live and all things live for Man 
To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek 
Illworthy I such title should belong 
Far other name deserving  But the field 
Her rosy progress smiling let us forth 
What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks 
After short blush of morn nigh in her sight 
Two birds of gayest plume before him drove 
Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight 
Forerunners of his purpose or to warn 
Why else this double object in our sight 
One way the selfsame hour why in the east 
And slow descends with something heavenly fraught 
He erred not for by this the heavenly bands 
Down from a sky of jasper lighted now 
The field pavilioned with his guardians bright 
War unproclaimed  The princely Hierarch 
None of the meanest some great Potentate 
Or of the Thrones above such majesty 
Clad to meet man over his lucid arms 
In time of truce Iris had dipt the woof 
His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime 
Defeated of his seisure many days 
And one bad act with many deeds well done 
But longer in this Paradise to dwell 
And send thee from the garden forth to till 
He added not for Adam at the news 
Discovered soon the place of her retire 
Must I thus leave thee Paradise thus leave 
With what to sight or smell was sweet from thee 
Into a lower world to this obscure 
And wild how shall we breathe in other air 
Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild 
Thy going is not lonely with thee goes 
Thy husband whom to follow thou art bound 
To Michael thus his humble words addressed 
Of them the highest for such of shape may seem 
Prince above princes gently hast thou told 
And in performing end us what besides 
Familiar to our eyes all places else 
Incessant I could hope to change the will 
To weary him with my assiduous cries 
But prayer against his absolute decree 
Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth 
Therefore to his great bidding I submit 
His blessed countenance  Here I could frequent 
With worship place by place where he vouchsafed 
So many grateful altars I would rear 
Or monument to ages and theron 
In yonder nether world where shall I seek 
Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts 
Of glory and far off his steps adore 
To whom thus Michael with regard benign 
Not this rock only his Omnipresence fills 
Fomented by his virtual power and warmed 
No despicable gift surmise not then 
His presence to these narrow bounds confined 
All generations and had hither come 
To dwell on even ground now with thy sons 
Present and of his presence many a sign 
To show thee what shall come in future days 
Expect to hear supernal grace contending 
With sinfulness of men thereby to learn 
And pious sorrow equally inured 
Prosperous or adverse so shalt thou lead 
Thy mortal passage when it comesAscend 
This hill let Eve for I have drenched her eyes 
Here sleep below while thou to foresight wakest 
To whom thus Adam gratefully replied 
However chastening to the evil turn 
My obvious breast arming to overcome 
If so I may attain  So both ascend 
Of Paradise the highest from whose top 
Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay 
His eye might there command wherever stood 
To Paquin of Sinaean kings and thence 
Down to the golden Chersonese or where 
In Hispahan or where the Russian Ksar 
Turchestanborn nor could his eye not ken 
The empire of Negus to his utmost port 
Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount 
The world in spirit perhaps he also saw 
Of Atabalipa and yet unspoiled 
Call El Dorado  But to nobler sights 
Which that false fruit that promised clearer sight 
Had bred then purged with euphrasy and rue 
And from the well of life three drops instilled 
But him the gentle Angel by the hand 
In some to spring from thee who never touched 
The excepted tree nor with the snake conspired 
Nor sinned thy sin yet from that sin derive 
New reaped the other part sheepwalks and folds 
A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought 
His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven 
Smote him into the midriff with a stone 
Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused 
Much at that sight was Adam in his heart 
Is piety thus and pure devotion paid 
From Heaven acceptance but the bloody fact 
Rolling in dust and gore  To which our sire 
But have I now seen Death  Is this the way 
I must return to native dust  O sight 
To whom thus Michael  Death thou hast seen 
In his first shape on Man but many shapes 
Before thee shall appear that thou mayest know 
What misery the inabstinence of Eve 
Shall bring on Men  Immediately a place 
A lazarhouse it seemed wherein were laid 
Numbers of all diseased all maladies 
Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch 
And over them triumphant Death his dart 
Sight so deform what heart of rock could long 
Though not of woman born compassion quelled 
Better end here unborn  Why is life given 
Glad to be so dismissed in peace  Can thus 
To such unsightly sufferings be debased 
Retaining still divine similitude 
To serve ungoverned Appetite and took 
Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve 
In what thou eatest and drinkest seeking from thence 
Till many years over thy head return 
A melancholy damp of cold and dry 
The balm of life  To whom our ancestor 
Which I must keep till my appointed day 
My dissolution  Michael replied 
And now prepare thee for another sight 
Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue 
Down to the veins of earth thence gliding hot 
From underground the liquid ore he drained 
Into fit moulds prepared from which he formed 
Down to the plain descended by their guise 
Freedom and peace to Men they on the plain 
In gems and wanton dress to the harp they sung 
With feast and musick all the tents resound 
The bent of nature which he thus expressed 
Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends 
To whom thus Michael  Judge not what is best 
Who slew his brother studious they appear 
Taught them but they his gifts acknowledged none 
Yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget 
Yet empty of all good wherein consists 
Bred only and completed to the taste 
The world erelong a world of tears must weep 
But now prepare thee for another scene 
Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise 
Single or in array of battle ranged 
One way a band select from forage drives 
With cruel tournament the squadrons join 
Deserted  Others to a city strong 
Assaulting others from the wall defend 
In other part the sceptered heralds call 
And judgement from above him old and young 
Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence 
Unseen amid the throng so violence 
Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew 
His brother for of whom such massacre 
To whom thus Michael  These are the product 
Of those illmated marriages thou sawest 
Produce prodigious births of body or mind 
And valour and heroick virtue called 
Of human glory and for glory done 
To judge them with his Saints him the Most High 
Rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds 
Exempt from death to show thee what reward 
Awaits the good the rest what punishment 
Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold 
The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar 
Allured them thence from cups to civil broils 
And testified against their ways he oft 
Triumphs or festivals and to them preached 
Began to build a vessel of huge bulk 
Smeared round with pitch and in the side a door 
With their four wives and God made fast the door 
From under Heaven the hills to their supply 
Sent up amain and now the thickened sky 
Like a dark cieling stood down rushed the rain 
No more was seen the floating vessel swum 
Though comfortless as when a father mourns 
O visions ill foreseen  Better had I 
Lived ignorant of future so had borne 
With thought that they must be  Let no man seek 
Which neither his foreknowing can prevent 
And he the future evil shall no less 
Man is not whom to warn those few escaped 
All would have then gone well peace would have crowned 
With length of happy days the race of Man 
But I was far deceived for now I see 
Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste 
And whether here the race of Man will end 
First seen in acts of prowess eminent 
Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace 
And fear of God from whom their piety feigned 
In sharp contest of battle found no aid 
Shall leave them to enjoy for the earth shall bear 
Into the sea  To sojourn in that land 
Raise him to be the second in that realm 
Shall them admonish and before them set 
And full of peace denouncing wrath to come 
On their impenitence and shall return 
The one just man alive by his command 
A world devote to universal wrack 
And sheltered round but all the cataracts 
Of Heaven set open on the Earth shall pour 
Beyond all bounds till inundation rise 
Above the highest hills  Then shall this mount 
Of Paradise by might of waves be moved 
To teach thee that God attributes to place 
And the clear sun on his wide watery glass 
As after thirst which made their flowing shrink 
With soft foot towards the deep who now had stopt 
Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed 
A dove sent forth once and again to spy 
Greatly rejoiced and thus his joy broke forth 
Far less I now lament for one whole world 
That God vouchsafes to raise another world 
To whom the ArchAngel  Dextrously thou aimest 
Though late repenting him of Man depraved 
And makes a covenant never to destroy 
The earth again by flood nor let the sea

Though bent on speed so here the ArchAngel paused 
If Adam aught perhaps might interpose 
Much thou hast yet to see but I perceive 
Thy mortal sight to fail objects divine 
Must needs impair and weary human sense 
Henceforth what is to come I will relate 
And while the dread of judgement past remains 
With some regard to what is just and right 
Shall spend their days in joy unblamed and dwell 
Under paternal rule till one shall rise 
Will arrogate dominion undeserved 
Concord and law of nature from the earth 
Hunting and men not beasts shall be his game 
Subjection to his empire tyrannous 
A mighty hunter thence he shall be styled 
Though of rebellion others he accuse 
Regardless whether good or evil fame 
To sow a jangling noise of words unknown 
Among the builders each to other calls 
And hear the din  Thus was the building left 
O execrable son so to aspire 
Above his brethren to himself assuming 
Dominion absolute that right we hold 
By his donation but man over men 
He made not lord such title to himself 
But this usurper his encroachment proud 
Stays not on Man to God his tower intends 
Siege and defiance  Wretched manwhat food 
Himself and his rash army where thin air 
To whom thus Michael  Justly thou abhorrest 
From reason and to servitude reduce 
Within himself unworthy powers to reign 
Subjects him from without to violent lords 
Who oft as undeservedly enthrall 
His outward freedom  Tyranny must be 
Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse 
Yet sometimes nations will decline so low 
Deprives them of their outward liberty 
Their inward lost  Witness the irreverent son 
His holy eyes resolving from thenceforth 
To leave them to their own polluted ways 
And one peculiar nation to select 
A nation from one faithful man to spring 
To worship their own work in wood and stone 
For Gods  Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes 
Which he will show him and from him will raise 
A mighty nation and upon him shower 
All nations shall be blest he straight obeys 
To Haran after him a cumbrous train 
Canaan he now attains I see his tents 
Of Moreh there by promise he receives 
From Hameth northward to the Desart south 
From Hermon east to the great western Sea 
Shall in his seed be blessed  By that seed 
From Canaan to a land hereafter called 
Into the sea To sojourn in that land 
Raise him to be the second in that realm 
Too numerous whence of guests he makes them slaves 
Till by two brethren these two brethren call 
Moses and Aaron sent from God to claim 
Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire 
To blood unshed the rivers must be turned 
His cattle must of rot and murren die 
A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down 
Of Egypt must lie dead  Thus with ten wounds 
The riverdragon tamed at length submits 
Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand 
Though present in his Angel who shall go 
All night he will pursue but his approach 
Darkness defends between till morning watch 
And craze their chariotwheels when by command 
Moses once more his potent rod extends 
Over the sea the sea his rod obeys 
And overwhelm their war  The race elect 
Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance 
Inglorious life with servitude for life 
To noble and ignoble is more sweet 
This also shall they gain by their delay 
In the wide wilderness there they shall found 
To mortal ear is dreadful  They beseech 
Instructed that to God is no access 
Moses in figure bears to introduce 
And all the Prophets in their age the times 
Among them to set up his tabernacle 
The Holy One with mortal Men to dwell 
By his prescript a sanctuary is framed 
The records of his covenant over these 
Of two bright Cherubim before him burn 
Seven lamps as in a zodiack representing 
The heavenly fires over the tent a cloud 
Promised to Abraham and his seedThe rest 
Were long to tell how many battles fought 
How many kings destroyed and kingdoms won 
Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still 
Just Abraham and his seed now first I find 
Of me and all mankind  But now I see 
Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means 
Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth 
So many and so various laws are given 
So many laws argue so many sins 
Among them how can God with such reside 
To whom thus Michael  Doubt not but that sin 
Sin against law to fight that when they see 
Some blood more precious must be paid for Man 
Of conscience which the law by ceremonies 
Cannot appease nor Man the mortal part 
So law appears imperfect and but given 
Up to a better covenant disciplined 
From shadowy types to truth from flesh to spirit 
From imposition of strict laws to free 
Acceptance of large grace from servile fear 
To filial works of law to works of faith 
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest 
Provoking God to raise them enemies 
From whom as oft he saves them penitent 
For ever shall endure the like shall sing 
Of David so I name this king shall rise 
The last for of his reign shall be no end 
Left in confusion Babylon thence called 
There in captivity he lets them dwell 
Returned from Babylon by leave of kings 
They first reedify and for a while 
Endeavour peace their strife pollution brings 
Upon the temple itself at last they seise 
Anointed King Messiah might be born 
His place of birth a solemn Angel tells 
Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung 
The power of the Most High  He shall ascend 
Without the vent of words which these he breathed 
Of utmost hope now clear I understand 
What oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain 
Why our great Expectation should be called 
High in the love of Heaven yet from my loins 
Of God Most High so God with Man unites 
Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise 
Expect with mortal pain  Say where and when 
Of head or heel  Not therefore joins the Son 
Thy enemy nor so is overcome 
And due to theirs which out of thine will grow 
So only can high Justice rest appaid 
The law of God exact he shall fulfil 
Alone fulfil the law thy punishment 
Proclaiming life to all who shall believe 
By his own nation slain for bringing life 
Never to hurt them more who rightly trust 
But soon revives Death over him no power 
Shall long usurp ere the third dawning light 
By faith not void of works  This Godlike act 
In sin for ever lost from life this act 
And fix far deeper in his head their stings 
A gentle wafting to immortal life 
Nor after resurrection shall he stay 
Still followed him to them shall leave in charge 
To teach all nations what of him they learned 
And his salvation them who shall believe 
Of washing them from guilt of sin to life 
So in his seed all nations shall be blest 
Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend 
Over his foes and thine there shall surprise 
With glory and power to judge both quick and dead 
Whether in Heaven or Earth for then the Earth 
And evil turn to good more wonderful 
Than that which by creation first brought forth 
Whether I should repent me now of sin 
The enemies of truth  Who then shall guide 
Worse with his followers than with him they dealt 
To guide them in all truth and also arm 
Though to the death against such cruelties 
And oft supported so as shall amaze 
As did their Lord before them  Thus they win 
Great numbers of each nation to receive 
With joy the tidings brought from Heaven  At length 
Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven 
To their own vile advantages shall turn 
Of lucre and ambition and the truth 
Though not but by the Spirit understood 
Secular power though feigning still to act 
Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force 
On every conscience laws which none shall find 
Shall on the heart engrave  What will they then 
Who against faith and conscience can be heard 
Infallible yet many will presume 
Whence heavy persecution shall arise 
Will deem in outward rites and specious forms 
Religion satisfied Truth shall retire 
Under her own weight groaning till the day 
Now ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord 
Satan with his perverted world then raise 
He ended and thus Adam last replied 
Greatlyinstructed I shall hence depart 
Greatly in peace of thought and have my fill 
Beyond which was my folly to aspire 
And love with fear the only God to walk 
As in his presence ever to observe 
Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest 
To whom thus also the Angel last replied 
Of all the rest then wilt thou not be loth 
Let us descend now therefore from this top 
Of speculation for the hour precise 
Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed 
Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard 
The great deliverance by her seed to come 
With meditation on the happy end 
And thus with words not sad she him received 
Wearied I fell asleep  But now lead on 
Is to go hence unwilling thou to me 
Who for my wilful crime art banished hence 
This further consolation yet secure 
By me the Promised Seed shall all restore 
So spake our mother Eve and Adam heard 
The Cherubim descended on the ground 
Began to parch that temperate clime whereat 
In either hand the hastening Angel caught 
To the subjected plain then disappeared 
Waved over by that flaming brand the gate 
Through Eden took their solitary way
