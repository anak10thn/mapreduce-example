walking across one of his fields on a certain December
morning   sunny and exceedingly mild  might have
regarded Gabriel Oak in other aspects than these In
his face one might notice that many of the hues and
curves of youth had tarried on to manhood there even
remained in his remoter crannies some relics of the boy
His height and breadth would have been sufficient to
with due consideration But there is a way some men
responsible than flesh and sinew  it is a way of curtail
ing their dimensions by their manner of showing them
And from a quiet modesty that would have become a
vestal which seemed continually to impress upon him

This may be said to be a defect in an individual if he
depends for his valuation more upon his appearance
for his intellect and his emotions were clearly separated 
he had passed the time during which the influence of
youth indiscriminately mingles them in the character
The field he was in this morning sloped to a
ridge called Norcombe Hill Through a spur of this
hill ran the highway between Emminster and Chalk
coming down the incline before him an ornamental
bearing a whip perpendicularly The waggon was
attractive Gabriel had not beheld the sight for more
standstill just beneath his eyes
waggoner
a caged canary   all probably from the windows of the
house just vacated There was also a cat in a willow
small birds around
The handsome girl waited for some time idly in her
hopping of the canary upand down the perches of its
prison Then she looked attentively downwards It
turned her head to learn if the waggoner were coming
He was not yet in sight and hereyes crept back to

smiled
a soft lustre upon her bright face and dark hair The
and girl with a peculiar vernal charm What possessed
her to indulge in such a performance in the sight of the
knows  it ended certainly in a real smile She blushed
more
The change from the customary spot and necessary
occasion of such an act   from the dressing hour in a
bedroom to a time of travelling out of doors   lent to
the idle deed a novelty it did not intrinsically possess
clothed it in the freshness of an originality A
cynical inference was irresistitle by Gabriel Oak as he
been There was no necessity whatever for her looking

taking up the glass She simply observed herself as a

which men would play a part   vistas of probable

when he heard a dispute lt was a difference con

tone of twopence remarkably insignificant Threepence

NIGHT   THE FLOCK  AN INIERIOR  ANOTHER INTERIOR
shortest day in the year A desolating wind wandered
from the north over the hill whereon Oak had watched
the yellow waggon and its occupant in the sunshine of
a few days earlier
  Norcombe Hill   not far from lonely TollerDown
   was one of the spots which suggest to a passerby
that he is in the presence of a shape approaching the
indestructible as nearly as any to be found on earth
It was a featureless convexity of chalk and soil   an
ordinary specimen of those smoothlyoutlined protuber
ances of the globe which may remain undisturbed on
and dizzy granite precipices topple down
The hill was covered on its northern side by an

crowning boughs in a weakened moan The dry leaves

two of the latest in date amongst the dead multitude

cealed bore some reduced resemblance to features here
almost of differing natures   one rubbing the blades
them like a soft broom The instinctive act of human
to each other in the regular antiphonies of a cathedral
choir how hedges and other shapes to leeward them
be heard no more
The sky was clear   remarkably clear  and the
twinkling of all the stars seemed to be but throbs of
was now at a right angle with the meridian A
difference of colour in the stars   oftener read of than
seen in Englandwas really perceptible here The
sovereign brilliancy of Sirius pierced the eye with a steely
Betelgueux shone with a fiery red
To persons standing alone on a hill during a clear
almost a palpable movement The sensation may be
caused by the panoramic glide of the stars past earthly
abiding The poetry of motion is a phrase much in
is necessary to stand on a hill at a small hour of the
dreamwrapt and disregardful of all such proceedings at
through the stars After such a nocturnal reconnoitre
consciousness of such majestic speeding is derived from
a tiny human frame
Suddenly an unexpected series of sounds began to
be heard
in this place up against the sky They had a
and a sequence which was to be found nowhere in
The tune was not floating unhindered into the open
too curtailed in power to spread high or wide It came
from the direction of a small dark object under the

been puzzled to attach either meaning or use

which was supplied from a flagon beneath Beside the
provisions lay the flute whose notes had lately been
called forth by the lonely watcher to beguile a tedious

 To find themselves utterly alone at night where company
is desirable and expected makes some people fearful but a
case more trying by far to the nerves is to discover some
sciousness that it is quite in isolation
 Farmer Oak went towards the plantation and pushed
through its lower boughs to the windy side A dim mass under
its back part the roof was almost level with the ground In
front it was formed of board nailed to posts and covered with
tar as apreservative Through crevices in the roof and side
 The place contained two women and two cows By the side
of the latter a steaming branmash stood in a bucket One

been busy on Norcombe hill lately
for their details In making even horizontal and clear
inspections we colour and mould according to the warts
within us whatever our eyes bring in Had Gabriel
been able from the first to get a distinct view of her 
slightly so would have been as his soul required a
divinity at the moment or was ready supplied with one
Having for some time known the want of a satisfactory
painted her a beauty
By one of those whimsical coincidences in which

forth tumbled ropes of black hair over a red jacket
Oak knew her instantly as the heroine of the yellow
woman who owed him twopence

Oak returned to his flock
A GIRL ON HORSEBACK   CONVERSATION
THE sluggish day began to break Even its position
and for no particular reason save that the incident of
there appeared in view an auburn pony with a girl on
shed She was the young woman of the night before
Gabriel instantly thought of the hat she had mentioned
as having lost in the wind possibly she had come to
look for it He hastily scanned the ditch and after
leaves Gabriel took it in his hand and returned to his
the loophole in the direction of the riders approach
She came up and looked around   then on the other
side of the hedge Gabriel was about to advance and
restore the missing article when an unexpected per
formance induced him to suspend the action for the
the plantation It was not a bridlepath   merely a
which made it impossible to ride erect beneath them
rapidity of her glide into this position was that of a

attainable sideways Springing to her accustomed

nearing the cattleshed she was met by a boy bringing
pail with the young woman
Soon soft spirts alternating with loud spirts came
sounds of a person milking a cow Gabriel took the

of it being shown bare to make Oak wish that the event
have been revealed There was a bright air and manner
desirability of her existence could not be questioned
which would have made mediocrity ridiculous was an
addition to recognised power It was with some
moon behind the hedge
her
charms to the portrait of herself she now presented
him with was less a diminuition than a difference The
startingpoint selected by the judgment was her height
above the height to be chosen by women as best All
features of consequence were severe and regular It
may have been observed by persons who go about the
classicallyformed face is seldom found to be united
features being generally too large for the remainder of
the frame  that a graceful and proportionate figure of
eight heads usually goes off into random facial curves
let it be said that here criticism checked itself as out
consciousness of pleasure From the contours of her
neek and shoulders  but since her infancy nobody had
ever seen them Had she been put into a low dress
she would have run and thrust her head into a bush
Yet she was not a shy girl by any means it was merely
her instinct to draw the line dividing the seen from the
unseen higher than they do it in towns
consciousness shown would have been vanity if a little
vision seem to have a tickling effect upon virgin faces
Gabriel had been irritating its pink surface by actual

at all
kept down to a small smile an inclination to laugh dis
shaded hollows of its mass but it being now an hour
a colour of their own
muscle of her lineaments and frame to a standstill
A perception caused him to withdraw his own eyes
from hers as suddenly as if he had been caught in a
theft Recollection of the strange antics she had
a hot face It was a time to see a woman redden who
was not given to reddening s a rule not a point in
the milkmaid but was of the deepest rosecolour From
wondered when she would recover coolness sufficient to
justify him in facing her again He heard what seemed
to be the flitting of a
looked She had gone away
With an air between that of Tragedy and Comedy 
Gabriel returned to his work
Five mornings and evenings passed The young
woman came regularly to milk the healthy cow or to
tact had deeply offended her   not by seeing what he
eyes there is no indecorum and she appeared to feel
without her own connivance It was food for great regret
with him it was also a contretemps which touched into
life a latent heat he had experienced in that direction

to bed supperless that night among the bare boughs

ewes he entered the hut and heaped more fuel upon
and to prevent it Oak laid a sack there and wheeled the
cot round a little more to the south Then the wind
spouted in at a ventilating hole   of which there was one
on each side of the hut

lighted and the door closed one of these must be kept
open   that chosen being always on the side away from

How long he remained unconseious Gabriel never
knew During the first stages of his return to percep

On opening his eyes he found that evening had sunk

teeth was beside him More than this   astonishingly

served in a tone which showed her to be that novelty
among women   one who finished a thought before
was endeavouring to catch and appreciate the sensation
the event passed on into the heap of bygone things
He wished she knew his impressions  but he would as
soon have thought of carrying an odour in a net as of
attempting to convey the intangibilities
of his feeling
in the coarse meshes of language So he remained
silent

Gabriel felt himself guilty of another want of tact

All this while he was perplexing himself about an
errand on which he might consistently visit the cottage

summer face and a winter constitutiona fine January
concern at the serious turn pastoral affairs seemed to be
taking
Gabriel had watched the blue woodsmoke curling
from the chimney with strange meditation At evening
he had fancifully traced it down the chimney to the
spot of its origin   seen the hearth and Bathsheba
beside it   beside it in her outdoor dress for the
clothes she had worn on the hill were by association
equally with her person included in the compass of his
affection they seemed at this early time of his love a
necessary ingredient of the sweet mixture called Bath

ornate   of a degree between finemarketday and wet

Nothing disturbed the stillness of the cottage save
 the chatter of a knot of sparrows on the eaves one
might fancy scandal and rumour to be no less the
staple topic of these little coteries on roofs than of
those under them It seemed that the omen was an

at which all superfluous barking was cynically avoided
as a waste of breath   in fact he never barked even

as being too generous in expressing a judgment impuls
Gabriel stood
feeling balanced between poetry and practicality
He regarded the red berries between them over and
his after life to be a cypher signifying a proposal of
marriage Bathsheba decisively turned to him
for a marriage would be very nice in one sense
At this criticism of her statement Bathsheba made
an addition to her dignity by a slight sweep away
from him

This dog had originally belonged to a shepherd of
that George knew the exact degrees of condemnation
signified by cursing and swearing of all descriptions
better than the wickedest old man in the neighbourhood
Long experience had so precisely taught the animal the
and trustworthy still
resemblance between him and George He was learn
further than the rudiments as yet   still finding an
insuperable difculty in distinguishing between doing a
thing well enough and doing it too well So earnest
would have chased them across the whole county with
the greatest pleasure if not called off or reminded when
to step by the example of old George
Thus much for the dogs On the further side of
farms Two hcdges converged upon it in the form of

next morning Only one responded   old George  the
garden  Gabriel then remembered
that he had left the
two dogs on the hill eating a dead lamb a kind of meat
which latterly he had only enjoyed on Sundays
assisted in waking by the abnormal reverberation of
chronic sound that only makes itself noticed by ceasing
This exceptional ringing may be caused in two ways   
to be caused by the running of the flock with great
velocity
forward ewes were kept apart from those among which
seemed to have absolutely vanished from the hill There
Not a single bleat He went to the hedge   a gap
footprints of the sheep Rather surprised to find
through the hedge They were not in the plantation
He called again  the valleys and farthest hills
resounded
as when the sailors invoked the lost Hylas on the Mysian
shore  but no sheep He passed through the trees and
where the ends of the two converging hedges of which
we have spoken were stopped short by meeting the brow
the sky   dark and motionless as Napoleon at St
Helena
A horrible conviction darted through Oak With
a sensation of bodily faintness he advanced  at one
some great reward for signal services rendered Oak
looked over the precipice The ewes lay dead and dying
representing in their condition just now at least two
hundred more
humanity often tore in pieces any politic intentions of
by gravitation A shadow in his life had always been
that his flock ended in mutton   that a day came and
found every shepherd an arrant traitor to his defenceless
sheep His first feeling now was one of pity for the
untimely fate of these gentle ewes and their unborn
lambs
It was a second to remember another phase of the
matter The sheep were not insured All the savings
of a frugal life had been dispersed at a blow  his hopes
of being an independent farmer were laid low   possibly
been so severely taxed during the years of his life between
hands
Oak recovered from his It was as remarkable as it was
characteristic that the one sentence he uttered was in
thankfulness   
do listlessly surveyed the scene By the outer margin
attenuated skeleton of a chromeyellow moon which
had only a few days to last   the morning star dogging
her on the left hand The pool glittered like a dead
shaking and elongating the reflection of the moon
to a phosphoric streak upon the water All this Oak
saw and remembered
As far as could be learnt it appeared that the poor
momentum enough to break down a portion of the
same day   another instance of the untoward fate which
so often attends dogs and other philosophers who
and attempt perfectly consistent conduct in a world
made up so largely of compromise
was receiving a percentage from the farmer till such
time as the advance should be cleared off Oak found
were really his own would be about sufficient to pay his
THE FAIR   THE JOURNEY  THE FIRE
TWO months passed away We are brought on to a
or hiring fair in the countytown of Casterbridge
At one end of the street stood from two to three
hundred blithe and hearty labourers waiting upon Chance
   all men of the stamp to whom labour suggests nothing
nothing better than a renunciation of the same among
having a piece of whipcord twisted round their hats
thatchers wore a fragment of woven straw shepherds
held their sheepcrooks in their hands and thus the
situation required was known to the hirers at a
glance
In the crowd was an athletic young fellow of some

given him more than it had taken away He had sunk

grew dusk Some merry men were whistling and
touched his flute which he carried there Here was
an opportunity for putting his dearly bought wisdom
into practice
He drew out his flute and began to play  Jockey to
sweetness and the sound of the wellknown notes
cheered his own heart as well as those of the loungers
earned in pence what was a small fortune to a destitute
man
By making inquiries he learnt that there was another
fair at Shottsford the next day
Weatherbury It was where Bathsheba had gone
two months before This information was like coming
from night into noon
Bathsheba had probably left Weatherbury long before
to it to lead Oak to choose Shottsford fair as his next
means uninteresting intrinsically If report spoke truly
any in the whole county Oak resolved to sleep at
and struck out at once   into the  high road which had
been recommended as the direct route to the village in
question
The road stretched through watermeadows traversed
which rode on in undisturbed
serenity On the higher levels the dead and dry carcases
of leaves tapped the ground as they bowled along helter
in the hedges were rustling their feathers and tucking
stopped to look at them He passed by YalburyWood
and the wheezy whistle of the hens
By the time he had walked three or four miles every
shape in thelandscape had assumed a uniform hue of
blackness He descended Yalbury Hill and could just

the waggon like a kettledrumstick He then dis

Oak suddenly ceased from being a mere spectator
by discovering the case to be more serious than he had
at first imagined A scroll of smoke blew aside and
revealed to him a wheatrick in startling juxtaposition

group
not alone The first man he came to was running

objects in other parts of the stream

ON Saturday Boldwood was in Casterbridge market
and became visible to him Adam had awakened from

A man is never more credulous than in receiving
favourable opinions on the beauty of a woman he is
satisfied now
And this charming woman had in effect said to

She was at this moment coolly dealing with a dashing

was evident that such a nature as his had no attraction

All this time Bathsheba was conscious of having
broken into that dignified stronghold at last His
following her everywhere This
triumph would have been the sweeter to her for this
piquing delay But it had been brought about by

Being a woman with some good sense in reasoning
sheba genuinely repented that a freak which had owed

BOLDWOOD IN MEDITATION   REGRET
BOLDWOOD was tenant of what was called Little
proach to aristocracy that this remoter quarter of the

were reanimated to expectancy  it was only Mr Bold
wood coming home again
and tails of halfadozen warm and contented horses
could be heard busily sustaining the abovenamed
warmth and plumpness by quantities of oats and hay
The restless and shadowy figure of a colt wandered
of all the eaters was occasionally diversified by the
rattle of a rope or the stamp of a foot
Pacing up and down at the heels of the animals was
Farmer Boldwood himself This place was his almonry
enveloped the scene
His squareframed perpendicularity showed more fully
now than in the crowd and bustle of the markethouse
In this meditative walk his foot met the floor with heel
was bent downwards just enough to render obscure the
still mouth and the wellrounded though rather prominent
and broad chin A few clear and threadlike horizontal
lines were the only interruption to the otherwise smooth
surface of his large forehead
which struck casual observers more than anything else
balance of enormous antagonistic forces   positives and
he was in extremity at once If an emotion possessed
He had no light and careless touches in his constitu
though not quite companionable in the eyes of merry
those acquainted with grief Being a man who read
ment to reproach him for when they chanced to end
tragically
Bathsheba was far from dreaming that the dark and
silent shape upon which she had so carelessly thrown a
seed was a hotbed of tropic intensity Had she known
had she known her present power for good or evil over
Boldwood was Nobody knew entirely  for though it
been seen at the high tides which caused them
Farmer Boldwood came to the stabledoor and looked
forth across the level fields Beyond the first enclosure
It was now early spring   the time of going to grass
had come abruptly   almost without a beginning It
was that period in the vernal quarter when we map
suppose the Dryads to be waking for the season The
vegetable world begins to move and swell and the saps
cranes and pulleys in a noisy city are but  pigmy efforts
eyes it lighted him up as the moon lights up a great
exterior from its former impassibleness  and his face
showed that he was now living outside his defences
It is the usual experience of strong natures when they
love
At last he arrived at a conclusion It was to go
across and inquire boldly of her
The insulation of his heart by reserve during these
more than once that the causes of love are chiefly
the truth of the proposition No mother existed to
idle ties for sense He became surcharged with the

with larks the low bleating of the flock mingling with

Bathsheba looked up at the completion of the

reddening He also turned and beheld Boldwood

Farmer Boldwood had read the pantomime denoting

that neither would recognize that he had originally
intended to enter the field He passed by with an
and doubt Perhaps in her manner there were signs
that she wished to see him   perhaps not  he could not
read a woman The cabala of this erotic philosophy
seemed to consist of the subtlest meanings expressed in
misleading ways
contained a mystery quite distinct from its obvious
until now
belief that Farmer Boldwood had walked by on business
or in idleness She collected the probabilities of the
to see what a great flame a little Wildfire was likely to
observing her would have been a feeling of surprise
and yet so like what a flirt is supposed to be
resolution to avoid an evil is seldom framed till the evil
is so far advanced as to make avoidance impossible
THE SHEEPWASHING   THE OFFER
BOLDWOOD did eventually call upon her She was
accidents of her position as an agriculturist   that being
still more natural to the circumstances The great aids
to idealization in love were present here  occasional
strangeness The smaller human elements were kept
out of sight  the pettinesses that enter so largely into
all earthly living and doing were disguised by the
accident of lover and lovedone not being on visiting
terms  and there was hardly awakened a thought in
Boldwood that sorry household realities appertained to
most prettily remembered Thus a mild sort of
like himself
It was the end of May when the farmer determined
to be no longer repulsed by trivialities or distracted by
suspense He had by this time grown used to being in
love the passion now startled him less even when it

to seek her there
The sheepwashing pool was a perfectly circular basin

long   in a minor sort of way Its activity in sucking
the moisture from the rich damp sod was almost a pro

flexible palisade upon its moist brink To the north

From the recesses of this knot of foliage the loud
notes of three cuckoos were resounding through the
still air
Boldwood went meditating down the slopes with his

pool by an inlet and outlet at opposite points of its

the most elegant she had ever worn   the reins of her
horse being looped over her arm Flagons of cider
were rolling about upon the green The meek sheep
were pushed into the pool by Coggan and Matthew
assisting the exhausted animals when the wool became
saturated and they began to sink They were let out
wetter than the rest  they resembled dolphins under a
dribbling forth a small rill

shouts of the washers above

expected as a beginning It was lowness and quiet

that word
As the conseiousness expands on learning that what
was fancied to be the rumble of wheels is the reverbera

came
that my present way of living is bad in every respect
This giving back of dignity for dignity seemed to
open the sluices of feeling that Boldwood had as yet
kept closed
her arm seemed so impressed that instead of cropping
the herbage she looked up

nor patience to learn such things I want you for my
wife   so wildly that no other feeling can abide in me

And then she turned away Boldwood dropped his

like the pain of a wound received in an excitement
PERPLEXITy   GRINDING THE SHEARS  A QUARREL
The rarest offerings of the purest loves are but a self
eventually able to look calmly at his offer It was one
which many women of her own station in the neighbour
wild to accept and proud to publish In every point of
to her doors his standing was sufficient his qualities
standing for deliverance from her whims Boldwood as
a means to marriage was unexceptionable she esteemed
that ordinary men take wives because possession is not
out possession with totally differing aims the method is
the same on both sides But the understood incentive

But a disquiet filled her which was somewhat to her

same breath that it would be ungenerous not to marry

temerity with a manner of extreme discretion Many of
her thoughts were perfect syllogisms unluckily they
always remained thoughts Only a few were irrational
which most frequently grew into deeds
  The next day to that of the declaration she found
shears for the sheepshearing All the surrounding
cottages were more or less scenes of the same operation

of the village as from an armury previous to a campaign

  With Bathsheba a hastened act was a rash act
time was very seldom gained At this period the
single opinion in the parish on herself and her doings
that she valued as sounder than her own was Gabriel
was such that on any subject even that of her love
had for the asking Thoroughly convinced of the

Her eyes were at their darkest and brightest now

All the ancient men ran in a jumbled throng after

Having once received the stimulus that her presence

Bathsheba checked her grief and wiped her eyes

note between the small convulsive sobs of convalescence
which follow a fit of crying as a groundswell follows a
storm The note was none the less polite for being

his actions beyond what appertained to his time of
performing them It was when the rest were all looking
away that Boldwood observed her  when they regarded

his thanks The meaning lay in the difference between

cheeks had lost a great deal of their healthful fire from

bright with the excitement of a triumph   though it was
a triumph which had rather been contemplated than
desired
with what Keats daintily calls a too happy happiness
This unwonted abstraction by love of all dignity from

proof that she was idolized

Bathsheba knew more of him now  he had entirely
worn in her eyes the sorry look of a grand bird without
the feathers that make it grand She had been awe

the penalty she was schooling herself to pay To have
brought all this about her ears was terrible but after a
while the situation was not without a fearful joy The
facility with which even the most timid woman some
times acquire a relish for the dreadful when that is
THE SAME NIGHT   THE FIR PLANTATION
AMONG the multifarious duties which Bathsheba had
voluntarily imposed upon herself by dispensing with the

officer of surveillance could have done but this tender

turned on the light to examine nooks and corners with
the coolness of a metropolitan policeman This cool
ness may have owed its existence not so much to her
fearlessness of expected danger as to her freedom from
the suspicion of any her worst anticipated discovery
and she went round to the farm paddock Here the
only sounds disturbing the stillness were steady munch
blowing of bellows slowly Then the munching would

apparel which came within
reach of their tongues
Above each of these a still keener vision suggested a
brown forehead and two staring though not unfriendly
that these phenomena were the features and persons of

Her way back to the house was by a path through a

This bit of the path was always the crux of the

take a companion Slipping along here covertly as

rustle of footsteps Her own instantly fell as gently as
snowflakes She reassured herself by a remembrance
only just outside her own door
apparently on the point of gliding past her when some
thing tugged at her skirt and pinned it forcibly to the
ground The instantaneous check nearly threw Bath
sheba off her balance In recovering she struck against
warm clothes and buttons
the man
her position with astonishment
The man to whom she was hooked was brilliant in
brass and scarlet He was a soldier His sudden
appearance was to darkness what the sound of a trumpet
than by what the lantern lighted The contrast of this
revelation with her anticipations of some sinister figure
in sombre garb was so great that it had upon her the
effect of a fairy transformation
spur had become entangled in the gimp which decorated
the skirt of her dress He caught a view of her face
with newborn gallantry
and stooped for the performance
The unfastening was not such a trifling affair The
rowel of the spur had so wound itself among the gimp
to be a matter of time
ground betwixt them threw the gleam from its open side
among the firtree needles and the blades of long damp
grass with the effect of a large glowworm It radiated
upwards into their
dusky shape becoming distorted and mangled upon the
treetrunks till it wasted to nothing
He looked hard into her eyes when she raised them
gaze was too strong to be received pointblank with her
own But she had obliquely noticed that he was young
sleeve
Bathsheba pulled again
vexed she hardly knew why
coming to no end She looked at him again
dignity   which was very little  as she could infuse into
a position of captivity
said
and the gathers of her dress began to give way like
liliputian musketry
But why should such a fair and dutiful girl have such
merry twinkle
sigh which had as much archness in it as a sigh could
a bone to a dog These moments will be over too
She closed her lips in a determined silence
Bathsheba was revolving in her mind whether by a
bold and desperate rush she could free herself at the
risk of leaving her skirt bodily behind her The
thought was too dreadful The dress   which she had
put on to appear stately at the supper   was the head
and front of her wardrobe  not another in her stock
soldier at so dear a price 
said her cool friend
low
Bathsheba really knew not what to say

Your light fingers were more eager than mine I wish it

Liddy had just retired to rest In ascending to her
seen him He was here once in that way when the
Casterbridge Grammar School for years and years
Learnt all languages while he was there  and it was
said he got on so far that he could take down Chinese
and listed a soldier but even then he rose to be a
sergeant without trying at all Ah such a blessing it
is to be highborn  nobility of blood will shine out even
be permanently offended with the man  There are
occasions when girls like Bathsheba will put up with
a great deal of
unconventional behaviour When they
ministrant was antecedently made interesting by being
a handsome stranger who had evidently seen better
days
So she could not clearly decide whether it was her
so meanly done as what I did to to sulk away like that
did not think his barefaced praise of her person an
insult now
never once told her she was beautiful

The wondrous power of flattery in passados at woman
is a perception so universal as to be remarked upon by
many people almost as automatically as they repeat a
without thinking much of the enormous corollaries
which spring from the proposition Still less is it acted
upon for the good of the complemental being alluded
to With the majority such an opinion is shelved with
all those trite aphorisms which require some catastrophe
to bring their tremendous meanings thoroughly home
When expressed with some amount of reflectiveness it
seems coordinate with a belief that this flattery must
be reasonable to be effective It is to the credit of
men that few attempt to settle the question by experi

some profess to have attained to the same knowledge

times that illluck should follow a man for honestly

Bathsheba was absolutely speechless And yet she
could not help feeling that the assistance he was render

Capitulation   that was the purport of the simple

more perfect meaning The careless sergeant smiled

HIVING THE BEES
THE Weatherbury bees were late in their swarming this
air and guessing their probable settling place Not only
out a whole season all the swarms would alight on the
lowest attainable bough   such as part of a currantbush
and there defy all invaders who did not come armed
with ladders and staves to take them
multitude against the unexplorable stretch of blue till
they ultimately halted by one of the unwieldy trees
spoken of A process somewhat analogous to that of
was observable The bustling swarm had swept the sky
a nebulous centre this glided on to a bough and grew
light
The men and women being all busily engaged in
saving the hay   even Liddy had left the house for the
purpose of lending a hand   Bathsheba resolved to hive
now faded to snuff colour   and ascended a dozen rungs
a voice that was beginning to have a strange power in
agitating her
Troy was just opening the garden gate
slid down the ladder By the time she reached the
up the hive
and put his foot on the ladder to ascend
So a whimsical fate ordered that her hat should be
taken off   veil and all attached  and placed upon his
Then the veil had to be tied at its lower edge round
his collar and the gloves put on him
He looked such an extraordinary object in this guise
outright It was the removal of yet another stake from
the palisade of cold manners which had kept him off
Bathsheba looked on from the gound whilst he was
holding up the hive with the other hand for them to
fall into She made use of an unobserved minute
whilst his attention was absorbed in the
operation to
arrange her plumes a little He came down holding
of bees
untie me and let me out I am nearly stifled inside
To hide her embarrassment during the unwonted
Bathsheba hesitated She had heard wondrous

He pointed to about a yard in front of him
some grains of relish in these highly novel proceedings
He flourished the sword by way of introduction
conscious was that the point and blade of the sword
above her hip then of their reappearance on her right
apparently passed through her body The third item
perfectly clean and free from blood held vertically in
was mere sleight of hand The sword passed behind
In an instant the atmosphere was transformed to

Never since the broadsword became the national

performance as now in the evening sunshine among the

An arc of silver shone on her right side the sword

It appeared that a caterpillar had come from the

a liquid stream   here a stream of tears She felt like
one who has sinned a great sin
PARTICULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK
PARTICULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK
WE now see the element of folly distinctly mingling
with the many varying particulars which made up the
character of Bathsheba Everdene It was almost foreign
to her intrinsic nature Introduced as lymph on the
much understanding to be entirely governed by her
understanding to the best advantage Perhaps in no
minor point does woman astonish her helpmate more
than in the strange power she possesses of believing
that of being utterly sceptical on strictures that she
knows to be true
Bathsheba loved Troy in the way that only selfreliant
women love when they abandon their selfreliance
When a strong woman recklessly throws away her
strength she is worse than a weak woman who has never
had any strength to throw away One source of her
inadequacy is the novelty of the occasion She has
never had practice in making the best of such a
condition Weakness is doubly weak by being new
Bathsheba was not conscious of guile in this matter
wherein cattle form the passing crowd and winds the
busy hum  where a quiet family of rabbits or hares lives
her utmost thoughts in this direction been distinctly
only have amounted to such a matter as that she felt
her impulses to be pleasanter guides than her discretion 
summer it was fresh as spring Her culpability lay in
her making no attempt to control feeling by subtle and
careful inquiry into consuences She could show others
vertues were as metals in a mine
The difference between love and respect was mark
edly shown in her conduct Bathsheba had spoken of
her interest in Boldwood with the greatest freedom to
thereby from the time of his daily journey afield to the
night That he was not beloved had hitherto been his
great that Bathsheba was getting into the toils
nearly olbscured it It was a result which paralleled
the oftquoted observation of Hippocrates concerning
physical pains
That is a noble though perhaps an unpromising love

which not even the fear of breeding aversion in the
bosom of the one beloved can deter from combating his
or her errors Oak determined to speak to his mistress
He would base his appeal on what he considered her
home
An opportunity occurred one evening when she had
gone for a short walk by a path through the neighbour
thus the way was quite a sunken groove between the
embowing thicket on either side Two persons could
not walk abreast
stood aside to let her pass
she had brushed somewhat quickly by him
to introduce the gallant sergeant through the channel of
another preamble
and for many steps nothing further was heard from her
quarter than the rustle of her dress against the heavy
cornears Then she resumed rather tartly

her to get far ahead of him till he could only see her

A distressing explanation of this anxiety to be rid of
him at that point now ensued A figure apparently rose
from the earth beside her The shape beyond all doubt
and at once turned back till a good two hundred yards
were between the lovers and himself

passing the tower he thought of what she had said about

ascended the external flight of steps at the top of which

There burnt upon her face when she met the light of
the candles the flush and excitement which were little
less than chronic with her now The farewell words of

and kindly given her time to decide upon that her
final decision was that she could not marry him She
had expressed to Oak an intention to wait till Boldwood
came home before communicating to him her conclusive
reply But Bathsheba found that she could not wait
It was impossible to send this letter till the next day
arose to take it to any one of the women who might be
in the kitchen
She paused in the passage A dialogue was going

Bathsheba had too much sense to mind seriously
what her servitors said about her  but too much womanly
redundance of speech to leave alone what was said till
it died the natural death of unminded things She
burst in upon them

For a moment Boldwood stood so inertly after this
that his soul seemed to have been entirely exhaled with
the breath of his passionate words He turned his face
by the twilight as his footsteps mixed in with the low
hiss of the leafy trees
and wildly attempted to ponder on the exhibition which
had just passed away Such astounding wells of fevered

dark margin of the earth appeared foreshores and promontor
and the unresting world wheeled her round to a contrasting

away with Troy
NIGHT   HORSES TRAMPING
THE village of Weatherbury was quiet as the graveyard
as the dead The church clock struck eleven The
air was so empty of other sounds that the whirr of the
and so was also the click of the same at their close
The notes flew forth with the usual blind obtuseness
of inanimate things   flapping and rebounding among
through their interstices into unexplored miles of space
in her bed with a sense of being disturbed She was
totally unconscious of the nature of the interruption to
had happened She left her bed and looked out of
the window The paddock abutted on this end of the
the uncertain gray a moving figure approaching the
horse that was feeding there The figure seized the
field Here she could see some object which circum
stances proved to be a vehicle for after a few minutes
light wheels
Two varieties only of humanity could have entered
the paddock with the ghostiike glide of that mysterious
figure They were a woman and a gipsy man A woman
was out of the question in such an occupation at this
might probably have known the weakness of the house
chosen it on
Weatherbury Bottom
and together they went to the paddock Beyond all
doubt the horse was gone
They listened Distinct upon the stagnant air came
the sounds of a trotting horse passing up Longpuddle

round and leaping upon the hedge without waiting for

Was Bathsheba altogether blind to the obvious fact

HOME AGAIN   A TRICKSTER
THAT same evening at dusk Gabriel was leaning over
before retiring to rest
A vehicle of some kind was softly creeping along
the grassy margin of the lane From it spread the
tones of two women talking The tones were natural
and not at all suppressed Oak instantly knew the
voices to he those of Bathsheba and Liddy
The carriage came opposite and passed by It was
the only occupants of the seat Liddy was asking
was answering them listlessly and unconcernedly Both
Bathsheba and the horse seemed weary
The exquisite relief of finding that she was here
Oak could only luxuriate in the sense of it All grave
reports were forgotten
difference between the eastern and western expanses
round the dim hillocks Gabriel might have been
there an additional halfhour when a dark form walked
shortly afterwards turned indoors to bed
looking over some papers or letters Her back was
and waited with tense muscles and an aching brow
Boldwood had not been outside his garden since
his meeting with Bathsheba in the road to Yalbury

number he had ever closely beheld By degrees a

apologize and beg forgiveness of Bathsheba with some

being quite unknown to him
room containing Bathsheba was pulled down Bold
wood augured ill from that sign Liddy came out
The farmer instantly went out by the gate He
as unforgiven   that was the issue of it all He had
seen her who was to him simultaneously a delight and
as a peculiarly privileged guest only a little earlier in
there now
Boldwood did not hurry homeward It was ten

house it now pulled up The lamp fixed to the head

to him Troy had what appeared to be a carpetbag
in his hand   the same that he had brought with him
It seemed as if he were going to leave again this very
night
Troy turned up the hill and quickened his pace
Boldwood stepped forward
The tone in which this word was uttered was all
that had been wanted to bring Boldwood to the
point
on
cudgel he carried in his hand He remembered it was
Boldwood

there is a breadth of vision in the free man which in

Troy handed a folded newspaper through the slit

Boldwood looked and read

CHAPTER XXXV
AT AN UPPER WINDOW
IT was very early the next morning   a time of sun and
heaven was here and there coated with thin webs of
incorporeal cloud which were of no efect in obscuring
day All the lights in the scene were yellow as to
The creeping plants about the old manorhouse were
objects behind them the effect of minute lenses of high
magnifying power
Just before the clock struck five Gabriel Oak and
to the fields They were yet barely in view of their
of a casement in one of the upper windows The two
men were at this moment partially screened by an elder
shade
A handsome man leaned idly from the lattice He
makes a first morning survey The man was Sergeant
a soldier taking his ease
and saw there enacted in years of leisure the scenes o
repentance that would ensue from this work of haste
That they were married he had instantly decided Why
had it been so mysteriously managed  It had become
to her miscalculating the distance  that the horse had
itself Could she have been entrapped  The union
was not only an unutterable grief to him it amazed
week in a suspicion that such might be the issue of
with liddy had to some extent dispersed the dread
Just as that imperceptible motion which appears like
stillness is infinitely divided in its properties from stili
despair differed from despair indeed
In a few minutes they moved on again towards the
house The sergeant still looked from the window
when they came up

Gabriel shook his head The soldier turned a little

The military man turned and surveyed the interior
direction Gabriel and Coggan began to move on
Jan reflected for a moment
I shall be down in the fields with you some time this
week  but I have a few matters to attend to first So
Troy threw the coin dexterously across the front plot
in its ricochet upon the road
and finding they were not stood back to let him pass on
The only signs of the terrible sorrow Boldwood had
the enlarged appearance of the veins in his forehead
shape sank by degrees over the hill To one who knew
the man and his story there was something more striking
in this immobility than in a collapse The clash of
discord between mood and matter here was forced

than a cry

motionless in the stackyard of Weatherbury Upper
The night had a sinister aspect A heated breeze
from the south slowly fanned the summits of lofty
sailing in a course at right angles to that of another

horses had moved with timidity and caution

the close of dry weather for the season Before twelve
hours had passed a harvest atmosphere would be a
bygone thing

on to the barn
This was the night which had been selected by
Sergeant Troy   ruling now in the room of his wife 
for giving the harvest supper and dance As Oak
approached the building the sound of violins and a
cloth Tufts and garlands of green foliage decomted
immediately opposite to Oak a rostrum had been
and a tanabourine quivering in his hand
midst a new row of couples formed for another
with cups and viands Troy was lolling beside her

Such was the argument that Oak set outwardly before
It is possible that there was this golden legend under

assistance for covering the ricks that very

folding doors
Gabriel looked in An unusual picture met his
eye
The candles suspended among the evergreens had
leaves tied about them were scorched Many of the
of their heads at such low levels being suggestive of
mops and brooms In the midst of these shone red
united breathings of the horizonal assemblage forming
a subdued roar like London from a distance Joseph

dimly visible an unimportant remnant of William Smali

Gabriel was greatly depressed This debauch boded
ill for that wilful and fascinating mistress whom the
faithful man even now felt within him as the embodi

one could fancy it to be lifted by machinery from below

figure might have been seen dragging four large water
heaps of treasure in grain were covered snug   two cloths

cloths Oak looked under the staddles and found a

the interstices with the material of some untied sheaves

storm

upon the blind
Then there came a third flash Manoeuvres of a
most extraordinary kind were going on in the vast
firmamental hollows overhead The lightning now was
mailed army Rumbles became rattles Gabriel from
his elevated position could see over the landscape at

the act of galloping about in the wildest and maddest
their heads to earth A poplar in the immediate fore
ground was like an ink stroke on burnished tin Then
that Gabriel worked entirely by feeling with his hands
describable manner flickered down near the top of the
rod It was the fourth of the larger flashes A moment
and he resolved to descend
Not a drop of rain had fallen as yet He wiped his
the unprotected
stacks Was his life so valuable to
him after all What were his prospects that he
and urgent labour could not be carried on without
such risk  He resolved to stick to the stack How
the other end of the chain to trail upon the ground
The spike attached to it he drove in Under the
shadow of this extemporized lightningconductor he
felt himself comparatively safe
Before Oak had laid his hands upon his tools again

with the brazen glare of shining majolica   every knot

head It had been the sixth flash which had come from

such a heavenly light could be the parent of such a
diabolical sound

The next flare came Bathsheba was on the ground

Simultaneously came from every part of the tumbling
than of anything eise earthly In the meantime one of
close juxtaposition with an infuriated universe
Oak had hardly time to gather up these impressions
and a new one among these terrible voices mingled with
the last crash of those preceding It was a stupefying
the tones of a drum to more distant thunder By the
lustre reflected from every part of the earth and from the
huge riband of bark being apparently flung off The
surface as a strip of white down the front The
lightning had struck the tree A sulphurous smell
in Hinnom
Bathsheba said nothing  but he could distinctly hear

the sharpest vision They both stood still at the

looked through the chinks of the door All was in
was looking into the same chink
He endeavoured to put off the immediate and pain
Oak looked up at her She had not spoken since
he left the barn The soft and continual shimmer of
the dying lightning showed a marble face high against
the black sky of the opposite quarter Bathsheba was

was broached

Gabriel ceased his rustling
breaking off my engagement to Mr Troy It was owing
to circumstances which occurred after I got there that
might seize hold of me for meeting him alone in that
and that his constancy could not be counted on unless
I at once became his And I was grieved and
with desperate impetuosity
Gabriel made no reply

upon the contradictoriness of that feminine heart which
had caused her to speak more warmly to him tonight
than she ever had done whilst unmarried and free to
speak as warmly as she chose
He was disturbed in his meditation by a grating
noise from the coachhouse It was the vane on the
signal for a disastrous rain

The air changed its temperature and stirred itself
more vigorously Cool breezes coursed in transparent
or two and blew stronger In ten minutes every wind
of heaven seemed to be roaming at large Some of the
thatching on the wheatstacks was now whirled fantas
away again at the barley A huge drop of rain smote

The rain stretched obliquely through the dull atmo

Oak suddenly remembered that eight months before
this time he had been fighting against fire in the same
spot as desperately as he was fighting against water

surface of the lane he saw a person walking yet more
slowly than himself under an umbrella The man

Boldwood seemed to awake to the present by degrees
regarding his companion
and was barely in time Never had such a struggle in
self It is difficult to describe the intensely dramatic
effect that announcement had upon Oak at such a
moment All the night he had been feeling that the
neglect he was labouring to repair was abnormal and
isolated   the only instance of the kind within the circuit

A flash of indignation might have been seen in
after this reply They moved on without further
hooded the road at this spot occasionally spinning
downward across their path to the earth
A woman appeared on the brow of the hill The
husband and wife before she became visible Troy had
his foot on the stepthe woman passed behind him
Though the overshadowing trees and the approach
see plainly enough to discern the extreme poverty of
A CRY
The woman said these words to Troy over his
shoulder
Troy started visibly at the sound of the voice yet
he seemed to recover presence of mind sufficient to
prevent himself from giving way to his impulse to

At the end of a short though undefined time she found

Bathsheba indulged in contempIations of escape from

The first time that she definitely noticed her position

nothing better to do with her palpitating self than to go

at other times watching every movement outside without

a livid cloud received its rays in the east Up against
this dark background the west front of the church

spot had been consecrated to this ancient diversion from

pavement by the players She could see the brown
and black heads of the young lads darting about right

THE GURGOYLE  ITS DOINGS
THE tower of Weatherbury Church was a square
gurgoyles on each of the four faces of its parapet Of
these eight carved protuberances only two at this time
continued to serve the purpose of their erection   that
of spouting the water from the lead roof within One
mouth in each front had been closed hy bygone church

still remained open and active were gaping enough to do
all the work
It has been sometimes argued that there is no truer
criterion of the vitality of any given artperiod than the
power of the masterspirits of that time in grotesque 
and certainly in the instance of Gothic art there is no
disputing the proposition Weatherbury tower was a
somewhat early instance of the use of an ornamental
original design that a human brain could conceive
which is less the characteristic of British than of
Continental grotesques of the period All the eight
were different from each other A beholder was con
vinced that nothing on earth could be more hideous
than those he saw on the north side until he went
that at the southeastern corner concerns the story It
enough like a bird to be called a griffin This horrible
stone entity was fashioned as if covered with a
wrinkled
open to give free passage to the water it vomited The
of feet from the wall against which its feet rested as a
sound

small stream began to trickle through the seventy feet
the waterdrops smote like duckshot in their accelerated
further from the side of the tower When the rain fell
in a steady and ceaseless torrent the stream dashed
downward in volumes

time The end of the liquid parabola has come forward
which had acted as a shield to the soil under the onset
These during the summer had been cleared from the
fall but the bare earth For several years the stream
had not spouted so far from the tower as it was doing

a tuft of stringy roots washed white and clean as a

dismay Troy turned the corner and then beheld the

effort of his newborn solicitousness A man who has
spent his primal strength in journeying in one direction

opposition had disheartened him To turn about would
have been hard enough under the greatest providential

He slowly withdrew from the grave He did not
anything at all He simply threw up his cards and
forswore his game for that time and always Going out
of the churchyard silently and unobserved   none of the
villagers having yet risen   he passed down some fields

ADVENTURES BY THE SHORE
TROY wandered along towards the south A composite
place on earth save Weatherbury The sad accessories

scenery of the coast Up the hill stretched a road

met the sky at the top about two miles off Through

There was a certain animal form of refinement in his
nature and however pleasant a strange condition might

England and Weatherbury Farm Whether Bathsheba
thought him dead was a frequent subject of curious
conjecture To England he did return at last  but the

an occasional fitful sentiment which sometimes caused
him as much inconvenience as emotion of a strong and

at first entering he would be beholden for food and
done so and he would then become liable for her
maintenance  and what a life such a future of poverty

establishment which existed for him there

place Bathsheba   who was driven to the fair that day
and careworn to be without a little curiosity to see him

of the possibility of some Weatherbury person or other

But here was Bathsheba in her own person and the
reality of the scene was so much intenser than any of
his prefigurings that he felt he had not half enough

As the summer drew on she passed more of her time

One Friday evening in August she walked a little way

chronic gloom of 
her life She was set thinking a great
deal about Oak and of his wich to shun her and there
occurred to Bathsheba several incidents of latter in
amounted together to a perceptible disinclination for
her society It broke upon her at length as a great
pain that her last old disciple was about to forsake her
and flee He who had believed in her and argued on
